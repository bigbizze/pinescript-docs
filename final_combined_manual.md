User Manual • Welcome to Pine Script™ v5

# Welcome to Pine Script ™ v5

Pine Script™ is TradingView's programming language. It allows traders to create
their own trading tools and run them on our servers. We designed Pine Script ™ as a
lightweight, yet powerful, language for developing indicators and strategies that
you can then backtest. Most of TradingView's built-in indicators are written in Pine
Script™, and our thriving community of Pine Script™ programmers has published
more than 100,000 Community Scripts.

It's our explicit goal to keep Pine Script ™ accessible and easy to understand for
the broadest possible audience. Pine Script ™ is cloud-based and therefore
different from client-side programming languages. While we likely won't develop
Pine Script ™ into a full-fledged language, we do constantly improve it and are
always happy to consider requests for new features.

Because each script uses computational resources in the cloud, we must impose limits in order to share these
resources fairly among our users. We strive to set as few limits as possible, but will of course have to implement as
many as needed for the platform to run smoothly. Limitations apply to the amount of data requested from additional
symbols, execution time, memory usage and script size.

# Introduction

Welcome to the Pine Script ™ v5 User Manual, which will accompany you in your journey to learn to program your own trading tools in Pine Script ™. Welcome also to the very active community of Pine Script™ programmers on TradingView.

In this page, we present a step-by-step approach that you can follow to gradually become more familiar with indicators and strategies (also called scripts) written in the Pine Script ™ programming language on TradingView. We will get you started on your journey to:

1. Use some of the tens of thousands of existing scripts on the platform.
2. Read the Pine Script ™ code of existing scripts.
3. Write Pine Script™ scripts.

If you are already familiar with the use of Pine scripts on TradingView and are now ready to learn how to write your own, then jump to the Writing scripts section of this page.

If you are new to our platform, then please read on!

# Using scripts

If you are interested in using technical indicators or strategies on TradingView, you can first start exploring the thousands of indicators already available on our platform. You can access existing indicators on the platform in two different ways:

- By using the chart's "Indicators & Strategies" button, or
- By browsing TradingView's Community Scripts, the largest repository of trading scripts in the world, with more than 100,000 scripts, most of which are free and open-source, which means you can see their Pine Script ™ code.

If you can find the tools you need already written for you, it can be a good way to get started and gradually become proficient as a script user, until you are ready to start your programming journey in Pine Script™.

# Loading scripts from the chart

To explore and load scripts from you chart, use the "Indicators & Strategies" button:



The dialog box presents different categories of scripts in its left pane:

*   Favorites lists the scripts you have "favorited” by clicking on the star that appears to the left of its name when you mouse over it.
*   My scripts displays the scipts you have written and saved in the Pine Script ™ Editor. They are saved in TradingView's cloud.
*   Built-ins groups all TradingVlew built-ins organized in four categories: indicators, strategies, candlestick patterns and volume profiles. Most are written in Pine Script ™ and available for free.
*   Community Scripts is where you can search from the 100,000+ published scripts written by TradingView users.
*   Invite-only scripts contains the list of the invite-only scripts you have been granted access to by their authors.

Here, the section containing the TradingView built-ins is selected:



When you click on one of the indicators or strategies (the ones with the green and red arrows following their name), it loads on your chart.

# Browsing Community Scripts

From , you can bring up the Community Scripts stream from the “Community” menu. Here, we are pointing to the "Editors' Picks" section, but there are many other categories you can choose from:

SCRIPTS

You can also search for scripts using the homepage's "Search" field, and filter scripts using different criteria. The
Help Center has a page explaining the different types of scripts that are available.

The scripts stream shows script widgets, i.e., placeholders showing a miniature view of each publication's chart and
description, and its author. By clicking on it you will open the script's page, where you can see the script on a chart,
read the author's description, like the script, leave comments or read the script's source code if it was published
open-source.

Once you find an interesting script in the Community Scripts, follow the instructions in the Help Center to load it on
your chart.

# Changing script settings

Once a script is loaded on the chart, you can double-click on its name (#1) to bring up its "Settings/Inputs" tab (#2):

The "Inputs" tab allows you to change the settings which the script's author has decided to make editable. You can
configure some of the script's visuals using the "Style" tab of the same dialog box, and which timeframes the script should appear on using the "Visibility” tab.
Other settings are available to all scripts from the buttons that appear to the right of its name when you mouse over
it, and from the "More" menu (the three dots):

The Pine Script ™ Editor

The Pine Script™ Editor is where you will be working on your scripts. While you can use any text editor you want to write your Pine scripts, using our Editor has many advantages:

*   It highlights your code following Pine Script ™ syntax.
*   It pops up syntax reminders for built-in and library functions when you hover over them.
*   It provides quick access to the Pine Script ™ v5 Reference Manual popup when you `ctrl` + `click` / `cmd` + `click` on Pine Script ™ keywords.
*   It provides an auto-complete feature that you can activate with `ctrl` + `space` / `cmd` + `space`
*   It makes the write/compile/run cycle fast because saving a new version of a script loaded on the chart also executes it immediately.
*   While not as feature-rich as the top editors out there, it provides key functionality such as search and replace, multi-cursor and versioning.

To open the Editor, click on the "Pine Script™ Editor" tab at the bottom of your TradingView chart. This will open up the Editor's pane.

First version

We will now create our first working Pine script, an implementation of the MACD indicator in Pine Script ™:

```
//@version=5
indicator("MACD #1")
fast = 12
slow = 26
fastMA = ta.ema(close, fast)
slowMA = ta.ema(close, slow)
macd = fastMA - slowMA
signal = ta.ema(macd, 9)
plot(macd, color = color.blue)
plot(signal, color = color.orange)
```

*   Start by bringing up the "Open" dropdown menu at the top right of the Editor and choose "New blank
    indicator".
*   Then copy the example script above, taking care not to include the line numbers in your selection.
*   Select all the code already in the editor and replace it with the example script.
*   Click "Save" and choose a name for your script. Your script is now saved in TradingView's cloud, but under your
    account's name. Nobody but you can use it.
*   Click "Add to Chart" in the Editor's menu bar. The MACD indicator appears in a separate Pane under your chart.

Your first Pine script is running on your chart, which should look like this:

Let's look at our script's code, line by line:

Line 1: `//@version=5`

This is a compiler annotation telling the compiler the script will use version 5 of Pine Script™.

Line 2: `indicator("MACD #1")`

Defines the name of the script that will appear on the chart as "MACD".

Line 3: `fast = 12`

Defines a `fast` integer variable which will be the length of the fast EMA.

Line 4: `slow = 26`

Defines a `slow` integer variable which will be the length of the slow EMA.
Line 5: `fastMA = ta.ema(close, fast)`
Defines the variable `fastMA`, containing the result of the EMA calculation (Exponential Moving Average) with a length equal to `fast` (12), on the `close` series, i.e., the closing price of bars.
Line 6: `slowMA = ta.ema(close, slow)`
Defines the variable `slowMA`, containing the result of the EMA calculation with a length equal to `slow` (26), from `close`.
Line 7: `macd = fastMA - slowMA`
Defines the variable `macd` as the difference between the two EMAs.
Line 8: `signal = ta.ema(macd, 9)`
Defines the variable `signal` as a smoothed value of `macd` using the EMA algorithm (Exponential Moving Average) with a length of 9.
Line 9: `plot(macd, color = color.blue)`
Calls the `plot` function to output the variable `macd` using a blue line.
Line 10: `plot(signal, color = color.orange)`
Calls the `plot` function to output the variable `signal` using an orange line.

## Second version
The first version of our script calculated MACD "manually", but because Pine Script™ is designed to write indicators and strategies, built-in Pine Script™ functions exist for many common indicators, including one for... MACD: `ta.macd()`.
This is the second version of our script:

```
//@version=5
indicator("MACD #2")
fastInput = input(12, "Fast length")
slowInput = input(26, "Slow length")
[macdLine, signalLine, histLine] = ta.macd(close, fastInput, slowInput, 9)
plot(macdLine, color = color.blue)
plot(signalLine, color = color.orange)
```

Note that we have:

*   Added inputs so we can change the lengths for the MAs
*   We now use the `ta.macd()` Pine Script™ built-in to calculate our MACD, which saves us three line and makes our code easier to read.

Let's repeat the same process as before to copy that code in a new indicator:

*   Start by bringing up the "Open" dropdown menu at the top right of the Editor and choose "New blank indicator".
*   Then copy the example script above, again taking care not to include the line numbers in your selection.
*   Select all the code already in the editor and replace it with the second version of our script.
*   Click "Save" and choose a name for your script different than the previous one.
*   Click "Add to Chart" in the Editor's menu bar. The "MACD #2” indicator appears in a separate Pane under the "MACD #1" indicator.

Your second Pine script is running on your chart. If you double-click on the indicator's name on your chart, you will bring up the script's "Settings/Inputs" tab, where you can now change the slow and fast lengths:

Let's look at the lines that have changed in the second version of our script:

Line 2: `indicator("MACD #2")`

We have changed `#1` to `#2` so the second version of our indicator displays a different name on the chart.

Line 3: `fastInput = input(12, "Fast length")`

Instead of assigning a constant value to a variable, we have used the `input()` function so we can change the value in our script's "Settings/Inputs" tab. `12` will be the default value and the field's label will be "Fast length". If the value is changed in the "Inputs” tab, the `fastInput` variable's content will contain the new value and the script will re-execute on the chart with that new value. Note that, as our Pine Script ™ Style Guide recommends, we add `Input` to the end of the variable's name to remind us, later in the script, that its value comes from a user input.

Line 4: `slowInput = input(26, "Slow length")`

We do the same for the slow length, taking care to use a different variable name, default value and text string for the field's label.

Line 5: `[macdLine, signalLine, histLine] = ta.macd(close, fastInput, slowInput, 9)`

This is where we call the `ta.macd()` built-in to perform all the first version's calculations in one line only. The function requires four parameters (the values after the function name, enclosed in parentheses). It returns three values into the three variables instead of only one, like the functions we used until now, which is why we need to enclose the list of three variables receiving the function's result in square brackets, to the left of the `=` sign. Note that two of the values we pass to the function are the "input" variables containing the fast and slow lengths: `fastInput` and `slowInput`.

Line 6 and 7:

The variable names we are plotting there have changed, but the lines are doing the same thing as in our first version.

Our second version performs the same calculations as our first, but we can change the two lengths used to calculate it. Our code is also simpler and shorter by three lines. We have improved our script.

We now recommend you go to our Next Steps page.

• How scripts are executed
• Time series
• Publishing scripts
• Getting around the Pine Script ™ documentation
• Where to go from here?

After your first steps and your first indicator, let us explore a bit more of the Pine Script™ landscape by sharing some
pointers to guide you in your journey to learn Pine Script ™.

"indicators" vs "strategies"
Pine Script™ strategies are used to backtest on historical data and forward test on open markets. In addition to
indicator calculations, they contain `strategy.*()` calls to send trade orders to Pine Script ™'s broker emulator,
which can then simulate their execution. Strategies display backtest results in the "Strategy Tester" tab at the
bottom of the chart, next to the "Pine Script ™ Editor" tab.

Pine Script™ indicators also contain calculations, but cannot be used in backtesting. Because they do not require the
broker emulator, they use less resources and will run faster. It is thus advantageous to use indicators whenever you
can.

Both indicators and strategies can run in either overlay mode (over the chart's bars) or pane mode (in a separate
section below or above the chart). Both can also plot information in their respective space, and both can generate
alert events.

How scripts are executed
A Pine script is not like programs in many programming languages that execute once and then stop. In the Pine
Script™ runtime environment, a script runs in the equivalent of an invisible loop where it is executed once on each
bar of whatever chart you are on, from left to right. Chart bars that have already closed when the script executes on
them are called historical bars. When execution reaches the chart's last bar and the market is open, it is on the
realtime bar. The script then executes once every time a price or volume change is detected, and one last time for
that realtime bar when it closes. That realtime bar then becomes an elapsed realtime bar. Note that when the script
executes in realtime, it does not recalculate on all the chart's historical bars on every price/volume update. It has
already calculated once on those bars, so it does not need to recalculate them on every chart tick. See the Execution
model page for more information.

When a script executes on a historical bar, the `close` built-in variable holds the value of that bar's close. When a script
executes on the realtime bar, `close` returns the current price of the symbol until the bar closes.

Contrary to indicators, Pine Script™ strategies normally execute only once on realtime bars, when they close. They
can also be configured to execute on each price/volume update if that is what you need. See the page on Strategies
for more information, and to understand how strategies calculate differently than indicators.

## Time series

The main data structure used in Pine Script™ is called a time series. Time series contain one value for each bar the
script executes on, so they continuously expand as the script executes on more bars. Past values of the time series
can be referenced using Pine Script™'s history-referencing operator: `[]`. `close[1]`, for example, refers to the value
of `close` on the bar preceding the one where the script is executing.

While this indexing mechanism may remind many programmers of arrays, a time series is different and thinking in
terms of arrays will be detrimental to understanding this key Pine Script™ concept. A good comprehension of both the
execution model and time series is essential in understanding how Pine scripts work. If you have never worked with
data organized in time series before, you will need practice to put them to work for you. Once you familiarize
yourself with these key concepts, you will discover that by combining the use of time series with our built-in functions
specifically designed to handle them efficiently, much can be accomplished in very few lines of Pine Script™ code.

## Publishing scripts

TradingView is home to a large community of Pine Script™ programmers and millions of traders from all around the
world. Once you become proficient enough in Pine Script™, you can choose to share your scripts with other traders.
Before doing so, please take the time to learn Pine Script™ well-enough to supply traders with an original and reliable
tool. All publicly published scripts are analyzed by our team of moderators and must comply with our Script Publishing
Rules, which require them to be original and well-documented.

If want to use Pine scripts for your own use, simply write them in the Pine Script™ Editor and add them to your chart
from there; you don't have to publish them to use them. If you want to share your scripts with just a few friends, you
can publish them privately and send your friends the browser's link to your private publication. See the page on
Publishing for more information.

## Getting around the Pine Script™ documentation

While reading code from published scripts is no doubt useful, spending time in our documentation will be necessary to
attain any degree of proficiency in Pine Script™. Our two main sources of documentation on Pine Script™ are:

- This Pine Script™ v5 User Manual
- Our Pine Script™ v5 Reference Manual

The Pine Script™ v5 User Manual is in HTML format and in English only.

The Pine Script™ v5 Reference Manual documents what each variable, function or Pine Script™ keyword does. It is an
essential tool for all Pine Script™ programmers; your life will be miserable if you try to write scripts of any reasonable
complexity without consulting it. It exists in two formats: the HTML format we just linked to, and the popup version,
which can be accessed from the Pine Script™ Editor, by either ctrl + clicking on a keyword, or by using the
Editor's "More/Pine Script™ reference (pop-up)" menu. The Reference Manual is translated in other languages.

There are five different versions of Pine Script™. Ensure the documentation you use corresponds to the Pine Script™
version you are coding with.

## Where to go from here?

This Pine Script™ v5 User Manual contains numerous examples of code used to illustrate the concepts we discuss. By
going through it, you will be able to both learn the foundations of Pine Script™ and study the example scripts. Reading
about key concepts and trying them out right away with real code is a productive way to learn any programming
language. As you hopefully have already done in the First indicator page, copy this documentation's examples in the
Editor and play with them. Explore! You won't break anything.

This is how the Pine Script ™ v5 User Manual you are reading is organized:

*   The Language section explains the main components of the Pine Script ™ language and how scripts execute.
*   The Concepts section is more task-oriented. It explains how to do things in Pine Script ™.
*   The Writing section explores tools and tricks that will help you write and publish scripts.
*   The FAQ section answers common questions from Pine Script ™ programmers.
*   The Error messages page documents causes and fixes for the most common runtime and compiler errors.
*   The Release Notes page is where you can follow the frequent updates to the Pine Script ™.
*   The Migration guides section explains how to port between different versions of Pine Script ™.
*   The Where can I get more information page lists other useful Pine Script ™-related content, including where to ask questions when you are stuck on code.

We wish you a successful journey with Pine Script™... and trading!

The execution model of the Pine Script ™ runtime is intimately linked to Pine Script ™'s time series and type system. Understanding all three is key to making the most of the power of Pine Script ™.

The execution model determines how your script is executed on charts, and thus how the code you write in scripts works. Your Pine Script ™ code would do nothing were it not for Pine Script ™'s runtime, which kicks in after your code has compiled and it is executed on your chart because one of the events triggering the execution of a script has occurred.

When a Pine Script ™ is loaded on a chart it executes once on each historical bar using the available OHLCV (open, high, low, close, volume) values for each bar. Once the script's execution reaches the rightmost bar in the dataset, if trading is currently active on the chart's symbol, then Pine Script™ indicators will execute once every time an update occurs, i.e., price or volume changes. Pine Script™ strategies will by default only execute when the rightmost bar closes, but they can also be configured to execute on every update, like indicators do.

All symbol/timeframe pairs have a dataset comprising a limited number of bars. When you scroll a chart to the left to see the dataset's earlier bars, the corresponding bars are loaded on the chart. The loading process stops when there are no more bars for that particular symbol/timeframe pair or the maximum number of bars your account type permits has been loaded [1]. You can scroll the chart to the left until the very first bar of the dataset, which has an index value of 0 (see bar_index).

When the script first runs on a chart, all bars in a dataset are historical bars, except the rightmost one if a trading session is active. When trading is active on the rightmost bar, it is called the realtime bar. The realtime bar updates when a price or volume change is detected. When the realtime bar closes, it becomes an elapsed realtime bar and a new realtime bar opens.

# Calculation based on historical bars

Let's take a simple script and follow its execution on historical bars:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("My Script", overlay = true)
a = close
src
a = ta.sma(src, 5)
b = ta.sma(src, 50)
c = ta.cross(a, b)
plot(a, color = color.blue)
plot(b, color = color.black)
plotshape(c, color = color.red)
```

On historical bars, a script executes at the equivalent of the bar's close, when the OHLCV values are all known for
that bar. Prior to execution of the script on a bar, the built-in variables such as `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`,
`volume` and `time` are set to values corresponding to those from that bar. A script executes once per historical bar.

Our example script is first executed on the very first bar of the dataset at index 0. Each statement is executed using
the values for the current bar. Accordingly, on the first bar of the dataset, the following statement:

```
src = close
```

initializes the variable `src` with the `close` value for that first bar, and each of the next lines is executed in turn.
Because the script only executes once for each historical bar, the script will always calculate using the same `close`
value for a specific historical bar.

The execution of each line in the script produces calculations which in turn generate the indicator's output values,
which can then be plotted on the chart. Our example uses the `plot` and `plotshape` calls at the end of the script
to output some values. In the case of a strategy, the outcome of the calculations can be used to plot values or dictate
the orders to be placed.

After execution and plotting on the first bar, the script is executed on the dataset's second bar, which has an index of
1. The process then repeats until all historical bars in the dataset are processed and the script reaches the rightmost
bar on the chart.

## Calculation based on realtime bars

The behavior of a Pine Script™ on the realtime bar is very different than on historical bars. Recall that the realtime
bar is the rightmost bar on the chart when trading is active on the chart's symbol. Also, recall that strategies can
behave in two different ways in the realtime bar. By default, they only execute when the realtime bar closes, but the
`calc_on_every_tick` parameter of the `strategy` declaration statement can be set to `true` to modify the
strategy's behavior so that it executes each time the realtime bar updates, as indicators do. The behavior described
here for indicators will thus only apply to strategies using `calc_on_every_tick=true`.

The most important difference between execution of scripts on historical and realtime bars is that while they execute
only once on historical bars, scripts execute every time an update occurs during a realtime bar. This entails that built-
in variables such as `high`, `low` and `close` which never change on a historical bar, can change at each of a script's
iteration in the realtime bar. Changes in the built-in variables used in the script's calculations will, in turn, induce
changes in the results of those calculations. This is required for the script to follow the realtime price action. As a
result, the same script may produce different results every time it executes during the realtime bar.

**Note:** In the realtime bar, the `close` variable always represents the current price. Similarly, the `high` and `low`
built-in variables represent the highest high and lowest low reached since the realtime bar's beginning. The Pine
Script™ built-in variables will only represent the realtime bar's final values on the bar's last update.

Let's follow our script example in the realtime bar.

When the script arrives on the realtime bar it executes a first time. It uses the current values of the built-in variables
to produce a set of results and plots them if required. Before the script executes another time when the next update
happens, its user-defined variables are reset to a known state corresponding to that of the last commit at the close of
the previous bar. If no commit was made on the variables because they are initialized every bar, then they are
reinitialized. In both cases their last calculated state is lost. The state of plotted labels and lines is also reset. This
resetting of the script's user-defined variables and drawings prior to each new iteration of the script in the realtime
bar is called rollback. Its effect is to reset the script to the same known state it was in when the realtime bar opened,
so calculations in the realtime bar are always performed from a clean state.

The constant recalculation of a script's values as price or volume changes in the realtime bar can lead to a situation
where variable `c` in our example becomes `true` because a cross has occurred, and so the red marker plotted by the
script's last line would appear on the chart. If on the next price update the price has moved in such a way that the
`close` value no longer produces calculations making `c` true because there is no longer a cross, then the marker
previously plotted will disappear.

When the realtime bar closes, the script executes a last time. As usual, variables are rolled back prior to execution.
However, since this iteration is the last one on the realtime bar, variables are committed to their final values for the
bar when calculations are completed.

To summarize the realtime bar process:

*   A script executes at the open of the realtime bar and then once per update.
*   Variables are rolled back before every realtime update.
*   Variables are committed once at the closing bar update.

## Events triggering the execution of a script

A script is executed on the complete set of bars on the chart when one of the following events occurs:

*   A new symbol or timeframe is loaded on a chart.
*   A script is saved or added to the chart, from the Pine Script™ Editor or the chart's "Indicators & strategies"
    dialog box.
*   A value is modified in the script's "Settings/Inputs" dialog box.
*   A value is modified in a strategy's "Settings/Properties" dialog box.
*   A browser refresh event is detected.

A script is executed on the realtime bar when trading is active and:
• One of the above conditions occurs, causing the script to execute on the open of the realtime bar, or
• The realtime bar updates because a price or volume change was detected.

Note that when a chart is left untouched when the market is active, a succession of realtime bars which have been opened and then closed will trail the current realtime bar. While these elapsed realtime bars will have been confirmed because their variables have all been committed, the script will not yet have executed on them in their historical state, since they did not exist when the script was last run on the chart's dataset.

When an event triggers the execution of the script on the chart and causes it to run on those bars which have now become historical bars, the script's calculation can sometimes vary from what they were when calculated on the last closing update of the same bars when they were realtime bars. This can be caused by slight variations between the OHLCV values saved at the close of realtime bars and those fetched from data feeds when the same bars have become historical bars. This behavior is one of the possible causes of repainting.

More information
• The Pine Script™ built-in `barstate.*` variables that provide information on the type of bar or the event where the script is executing. The page where they are documented also contains a script that allows you to visualize the difference between elapsed realtime and historical bars, for example.
• The Strategies page explains the details of strategy calculations, which are not identical to those of indicators.

## Execution of Pine Script ™ functions and historical context inside function blocks

The history of series variables used inside Pine Script ™ functions is created through each successive call to the function. If the function is not called on each bar the script runs on, this will result in disparities between the historic values of series inside vs outside the function's local block. Hence, series referenced inside and outside the function using the same index value will not refer to the same point in history if the function is not called on each bar.

Let's look at this example script where the `f()` and `f2()` functions are called every second bar:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("My Script", overlay = true)
// Returns the value of "a" the last time the function was called 2 bars ago.
f(a) => a[1]
// Returns the value of last bar's "close", as expected.
f2 () => close [1]

oneBarInTwo = bar index % 2 == 0
plot(oneBarInTwo ? f(close) : na, color = color.maroon, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_line)
plot(oneBarInTwo ? f2() : na, color = color.lime, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_circles)
plot(close [2], color = color.maroon)
plot(close [1], color = color.lime)
```

As can be seen with the resulting plots, `a[1]` returns the previous value of `a` in the function's context, so the last time `f()` was called two bars ago - not the close of the previous bar, as `close[1]` does in `f2()`. This results in `a[1]` in the function block referring to a different past value than `close[1]` even though they use the same index of 1.

## Why this behavior?

This behavior is required because forcing execution of functions on each bar would lead to unexpected results, as would be the case for a `label.new()` function call inside an `if` branch, which must not execute unless the `if` condition requires it.

On the other hand, this behavior leads to unexpected results with certain built-in functions which require being executed each bar to correctly calculate their results. Such functions will not return expected results if they are placed in contexts where they are not executed every bar, such as `if` branches.

The solution in these cases is to take those function calls outside their context so they can be executed on every bar. In this script, `ta.barssince()` is not called on every bar because it is inside a ternary operator's conditional branch:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Barssince", overlay = false)
res = close > close[1] ? ta.barssince(close < close[1]) : -1
plot(res, style = plot.style_histogram, color=res >= 0 ? color.red : color.blue)
```

This leads to incorrect results because `ta.barssince()` is not executed on every bar:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Barssince", overlay = false)
b = ta.barssince(close < close[1])
res = close > close[1] ? b : -1
plot(res, style = plot.style_histogram, color = res >= 0 ? color.red : color.blue)
```

Using this technique we get the expected output:

## Exceptions

Not all built-in functions need to be executed every bar. These are the functions which do not require it, and so do not need special treatment:

dayofmonth, dayofweek, hour, linebreak, math.abs, math.acos, math.asin, math.atan, math
math.cos, math.exp, math.floor, math.log, math.log10, math.max, math.min, math.pow, ma
math.sign, math.sin, math.sqrt, math.tan, minute, month, na, nz, second, str.tostring,
ticker.heikinashi, ticker.kagi, ticker.new, ticker.renko, time, timestamp, weekofyear,

**Note**
Functions called from within a `for` loop use the same context in each of the loop's iterations. In the example
below, each `ta.lowest()` call on the same bar uses the value that was passed to it, i.e., `bar_index`, so function
calls used in loops do not require special treatment.

```
//@version=5
indicator("My Script")
va = 0.0
for i = 1 to 2 by 1
    if (i + bar_index) % 2 == 0
        va := ta.lowest(bar_index, 10) // same context on each call
plot(va)
```

**Footnotes**

[1] The upper limit for the total number of historical bars is about 10000 for Pro/Pro+ users and about 20000 for
Premium users. Free users are able to see about 5000 bars.

# Time series

Much of the power of Pine Script ™ stems from the fact that it is designed to process time series efficiently. Time
series are not a form or a type; they are the fundamental structure Pine Script™ uses to store the successive values of
a variable over time, where each value is tethered to a point in time. Since charts are composed of bars, each
representing a particular point in time, time series are the ideal data structure to work with values that may change
with time.

The notion of time series is intimately linked to Pine Script ™'s execution model and type system concepts.
Understanding all three is key to making the most of the power of Pine Script ™.

Take the built-in `open` variable, which contains the "open" price of each bar in the dataset, the dataset being all the
bars on any given chart. If your script is running on a 5min chart, then each value in the `open` time series is the
"open" price of the consecutive 5min chart bars. When your script refers to `open`, it is referring to the “open” price
of the bar the script is executing on. To refer to past values in a time series, we use the `[]` history-referencing
operator. When a script is executing on a given bar, `open[1]` refers to the value of the `open` time series on the
previous bar.

While time series may remind programmers of arrays, they are totally different. Pine Script ™ does use an array data
structure, but it is a completely different concept than a time series.

Time series in Pine Script™, combined with its special type of runtime engine and built-in functions, are what makes it
easy to compute the cumulative total of `close` values without using a `for` loop, with only `ta.cum(close)`. This is
possible because although `ta.cum(close)` appears rather static in a script, it is in fact executed on each bar, so its
value becomes increasingly larger as the `close` value of each new bar is added to it. When the script reaches the
rightmost bar of the chart, `ta.cum(close)` returns the sum of the `close` value from all bars on the chart.

Similarly, the mean of the difference between the last 14 `high` and `low` values can be expressed as
`ta.sma(high - low, 14)`, or the distance in bars since the last time the chart made five consecutive higher
highs as `barssince(rising(high, 5))`.

Even the result of function calls on successive bars leaves a trace of values in a time series that can be referenced
using the `[]` history-referencing operator. This can be useful, for example, when testing the `close` of the current bar
for a breach of the highest `high` in the last 10 bars, but excluding the current bar, which we could write as
`breach = close > highest(close, 10)[1]`. The same statement could also be written as
`breach = close > highest(close[1], 10)`.

The same looping logic on all bars is applied to function calls such as `plot(open)` which will repeat on each bar,
successively plotting on the chart the value of `open` for each bar.

Do not confuse "time series” with the "series” form. The time series concept explains how consecutive values of
variables are stored in Pine Script ™; the "series” form denotes variables whose values can change bar to bar.
Consider, for example, the `timeframe.period` built-in variable which is of form "simple” and type "string", so "simple
string". The "simple” form entails that the variable's value is known on bar zero (the first bar where the script
executes) and will not change during the script's execution on all the chart's bars. The variable's value is the chart's
timeframe in string format, so "D" for a 1D chart, for example. Even though its value cannot change during the
script, it would be syntactically correct in Pine Script ™ (though not very useful) to refer to its value 10 bars ago using
`timeframe.period[10]`. This is possible because the successive values of timeframe.period for each bar are
stored in a time series, even though all the values in that particular time series are similar. Note, however, that when
the `[]` operator is used to access past values of a variable, it yields a result of "series" form, even though the variable
without an offset is of another form, such as "simple” in the case of timeframe.period.

When you grasp how time series can be efficiently handled using Pine Script ™'s syntax and its , you
can define complex calculations using little code.

User Manual • Language • Script structure

# Script structure

- Version
- Declaration statement
- Code
- Comments
- Line wrapping
- Compiler annotations

A Pine script follows this general structure:

```
<version>
<declaration statement>
<code>
```

# Version

A compiler annotation in the following form tells the compiler which of the versions of Pine Script™ the script is written in:

```
//@version=5
```

- The version number can be 1 to 5.
- The compiler annotation is not mandatory. When omitted, version 1 is assumed. It is strongly recommended to always use the latest version of the language.
- While it is synctactically correct to place the version compiler annotation anywhere in the script, it is much more useful to readers when it appears at the top of the script.

Notable changes to the current version of Pine Script™ are documented in the Release notes.

# Declaration statement

All Pine scripts must contain one declaration statement, which is a call to one of these functions:

- `indicator()`
- `strategy()`
- `library()`

The declaration statement:

- Identifies the type of the script, which in turn dictates which content is allowed in it, and how it can be used
- and executed.
- Sets key properties of the script such as its name, where it will appear when it is added to a chart, the precision and format of the values it displays, and certain values that govern its runtime behavior, such as the maximum number of drawing objects it will display on the chart. With strategies, the properties include parameters that control backtesting, such as initial capital, commission, slippage, etc.

Each type of script has distinct requirements:
- Indicators must contain at least one function call which produces output on the chart (e.g., `plot()`, `plotshape()`, `barcolor()`, `line.new()`, etc.).
- Strategies must contain at least one `strategy.*()` call, e.g., `strategy.entry()`.
- Libraries must contain at least one exported `function` or `user-defined type`.

## Code

Lines in a script that are not `comments` or `compiler annotations` are statements, which implement the script's algorithm. A statement can be one of these:
- variable declaration
- variable reassignement
- function declaration
- built-in function call, `user-defined function call` or a `library function call`
- `if`, `for`, `while`, `switch` or `type` structure.

Statements can be arranged in multiple ways:
- Some statements can be expressed in one line, like most variable declarations, lines containing only a function call or single-line function declarations. Lines can also be `wrapped` (continued on multiple lines). Multiple one-line statements can be concatenated on a single line by using the comma as a separator.
- Others statements such as structures or multi-line function declarations always require multiple lines because they require a local block. A local block must be indented by a tab or four spaces. Each local block defines a distinct `local scope`.
- Statements in the global scope of the script (i.e., which are not part of local blocks) cannot begin with white space (a space or a tab). Their first character must also be the line's first character. Lines beginning in a line's first position become by definition part of the script's global scope.

A simple valid Pine Script ™ v5 indicator can be generated in the Pine Script ™ Editor by using the "Open" button and choosing "New blank indicator":

```
//@version=5
indicator("My Script")
plot(close)
```

This indicator includes three local blocks, one in the `plot()` function declaration, and two in the variable declaration using an `if` structure:

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true) // Declaration statement (global scope)
barIsUp() => // Function declaration (global scope)
close > open // Local block (local scope)
plotColor = if barIsUp() // Variable declaration (global scope)
    color.green // Local block (local scope)
else
    color.red // Local block (local scope)
bgcolor(color.new(plotColor, 70)) // Call to a built-in function (global scope)
```

You can bring up a simple Pine Script™ v5 strategy by selecting "New blank strategy" instead:

```
//@version=5
strategy("My Strategy", overlay=true, margin_long=100, margin_short=100)
longCondition = ta.crossover(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
if (longCondition)
    strategy.entry("My Long Entry Id", strategy.long)

shortCondition = ta.crossunder(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
if (shortCondition)
    strategy.entry("My Short Entry Id", strategy.short)
```

## Comments

Double slashes (`//`) define comments in Pine Script™. Comments can begin anywhere on the line. They can also follow Pine Script™ code on the same line:

```
//@version=5
indicator("")
// This line is a comment
a = close // This is also a comment
plot(a)
```

The Pine Script™ Editor has a keyboard shortcut to comment/uncomment lines: `ctrl + /`. You can use it on multiple lines by highlighting them first.

## Line wrapping

Long lines can be split on multiple lines, or "wrapped". Wrapped lines must be indented with any number of spaces, provided it's not a multiple of four (those boundaries are used to indent local blocks):

`a = open + high + low + close`

may be wrapped as:

```
a = open +
high +
low +
close
```

A long `plot()` call may be wrapped as:

```
plot(ta.correlation(src, ovr, length),
color = color.new(color.purple, 40),
style = plot.style_area,
trackprice = true)
```

Statements inside user-defined function declarations can also be wrapped. However, since a local block must
syntactically begin with an indentation (4 spaces or 1 tab), when splitting it onto the following line, the continuation
of the statement must start with more than one indentation (not equal to a multiple of four spaces). For example:

```
updown(s) =>
    isEqual = s == s[1]
    isGrowing = s > s[1]
    ud = isEqual ?
        0 :
        isGrowing ?
            (nz(ud[1]) <= 0 ?
                1 :
                nz(ud[1])+1) :
            (nz(ud[1]) >= 0 ?
                -1 :
                nz(ud[1])-1)
```

You can use comments in wrapped lines:

```
//@version=5
indicator("")
c = open > close ? color.red :
     high > high[1] ? color.lime : // A comment
     low  < low[1]  ? color.blue : color.black
bgcolor(c)
```

## Compiler annotations

Compiler annotations accomplish different purposes:

*   `// @version=` is used to specify the version of Pine Script™ used in a script.
*   `// @description` is used to provide a description for a library.
*   `// @function`, `// @param` and `// @returns` are used to document function definitions.
*   `// @type` and `// @field` are used to document user-defined type (UDT) definitions.
*   `// @variable` is used to document variable declarations.
*   `// #region` and `// #endregion` can be used in scripts to create collapsible blocks in the Editor.

This script draws a rectangle using three interactively selected points on the chart. It illustrates how compiler
annotations can be used:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Triangle", "", true)

int TIME_DEFAULT = 0
float PRICE_DEFAULT = 0.0

x1Input = input.time(TIME_DEFAULT, "Point 1", inline = "1", confirm = true)
ylInput = input.price(PRICE_DEFAULT, "", inline = "1", tooltip = "Pick point 1", confirm = true)
x2Input = input.time(TIME_DEFAULT, "Point 2", inline = "2", confirm = true)
y2Input = input.price(PRICE_DEFAULT, "", inline = "2", tooltip = "Pick point 2", confirm = true)
x3Input = input.time(TIME_DEFAULT, "Point 3", inline = "3", confirm = true)
y3Input = input.price(PRICE_DEFAULT, "", inline = "3", tooltip = "Pick point 3", confirm = true)

// @type
// @field timel Time of first point.
// @field time2 Time of second point.
// @field time3 Time of third point.
// @field pricel Price of first point.
// @field price2 Price of second point.
// @field price3 Price of third point.
// @field lineColor Color to be used to draw the triangle lines.
type Triangle
    int timel
    int time2
    int time3
    float pricel
    float price2
    float price3
    color lineColor

//@function Draws a triangle using the coordinates of the `t` object.
//@param t (Triangle) Object representing the triangle to be drawn.
//@returns The ID of the last line drawn.
drawTriangle (Triangle t) =>
    line.new(t.timel, t.pricel, t.time2, t.price2, xloc = xloc.bar_time, color = t.lineColor)
    line.new(t.time2, t.price2, t.time3, t.price3, xloc = xloc.bar_time, color = t.lineColor)
    line.new(t.timel, t.pricel, t.time3, t.price3, xloc = xloc.bar_time, color = t.lineColor)

// Draw the triangle only once on the last historical bar.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    //@variable Used to hold the Triangle object to be drawn.
    Triangle triangle = Triangle.new()

    triangle.timel := x1Input
    triangle.time2 := x2Input
    triangle.time3 := x3Input
    triangle.pricel := ylInput
    triangle.price2 := y2Input
    triangle.price3 := y3Input
    triangle.lineColor := color.purple

    drawTriangle(triangle)
```

# Identifiers

Identifiers are names used for user-defined variables and functions:

*   They must begin with an uppercase (`A-Z`) or lowercase (`a-z`) letter, or an underscore (`_`).
*   The next characters can be letters, underscores or digits (`0-9`).
*   They are case-sensitive.

Here are some examples:

```
myVar
_myVar
my123Var
functionName
MAX_LEN
max_len
maxLen
3barsDown // NOT VALID!
```

The  recommends using uppercase SNAKE_CASE for constants, and camelCase for other identifiers:

```
GREEN_COLOR = #4CAF50
MAX_LOOKBACK = 100
int fastLength = 7
// Returns 1 if the argument is `true`, 0 if it is `false` or `na`.
zeroOne(boolValue) => boolValue ? 1 : 0

# Operators

*   Introduction
*   Arithmetic operators
*   Comparison operators
*   Logical operators
*   `?:` ternary operator
*   `[]` history-referencing operator
*   Operator precedence
*   `=` assignement operator

# Introduction

Some operators are used to build expressions returning a result:

*   Arithmetic operators
*   Comparison operators
*   Logical operators
*   The `?:` ternary operator
*   The `[]` history-referencing operator

Other operators are used to assign values to variables:

*   `=` is used to assign a value to a variable, but only when you declare the variable (the first time you use it)
*   `:=` is used to assign a value to a previously declared variable. The following operators can also be used in such a way: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`

As is explained in the  page, forms and types play a critical role in determining the type of results that expressions yield. This, in turn, has an impact on how and with what functions you will be allowed to use those results. Expressions always return a form of the strongest one used in the expression, e.g., if you multiply an "input int" with a "series int", the expression will produce a “series int" result, which you will not be able to use as the argument to `length` in `ta.ema()`.

This script will produce a compilation error:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("")
lenInput = input.int(14, "Length")
factor = year > 2020 ? 3 : 1
adjustedLength = lenInput * factor
ma = ta.ema (close, adjustedLength) // Compilation error!
plot(ma)
```

The compiler will complain: Cannot call ‘ta.ema' with argument 'length'='adjustedLength'. An argument of 'series
int' type was used but a 'simple int' is expected;. This is happening because `lenInput` is an "input int" but
`factor` is a "series int” (it can only be determined by looking at the value of `year` on each bar). The
`adjustedLength` variable is thus assigned a "series int" value. Our problem is that the Reference Manual entry for
`ta.ema()` tells us that its `length` parameter requires values of "simple" form, which is a weaker form that "series",
so a "series int" value is not allowed.

The solution to our conundrum requires:
* Using another moving average function that supports a "series int" length, such as `ta.sma()`, or
* Not using a calculation producing a “series int" value for our length.

## Arithmetic operators
There are five arithmetic operators in Pine Script ™:

| Operator | Description |
|---|---|
| + | Addition and string concatenation |
| - | Subtraction |
| * | Multiplication |
| / | Division |
| % | Modulo (remainder after division) |

The arithmetic operators above are all binary (means they need two operands or values to work on, like in
`1 + 2`). The `+` and `-` also serve as unary operators (means they work on one operand, like `-1` or `+1`).

If both operands are numbers but at least one of these is of `float` type, the result will also be a `float`. If both operands
are of `int` type, the result will also be an `int`. If at least one operand is `na`, the result is also `na`.

The `+` operator also serves as the concatenation operator for strings. `"EUR"`+`"USD"` yields the `"EURUSD"` string.

The `%` operator calculates the modulo by rounding down the quotient to the lowest possible value. Here is an easy
example that helps illustrate how the modulo is calculated behind the scenes:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("Modulo function")
modulo(series int a, series int b) =>
    a - b * math.floor(nz(a/b))
plot(modulo(-1, 100))
```

## Comparison operators
There are six comparison operators in Pine Script ™:

| Operator | Description |
|---|---|
| < | Less Than |
| <= | Less Than or Equal To |
| != | Not Equal |
| == | Equal |
| > | Greater Than |
| >= | Greater Than or Equal To |

Comparison operations are binary. If both operands have a numerical value, the result will be of type `bool`, i.e., `true`, `false` or `na`.

Examples

```
1 > 2     // false
1 != 1    // false
close >= open  // Depends on values of `close` and `open`
```

## Logical operators
There are three logical operators in Pine Script™:

| Operator | Description |
|---|---|
| not | Negation |
| and | Logical Conjunction |
| or | Logical Disjunction |

The operator `not` is unary. When applied to a `true`, operand the result will be `false`, and vice versa.

`and` operator truth table:

| a     | b     | a and b |
| :---- | :---- | :------ |
| true  | true  | true    |
| true  | false | false   |
| false | true  | false   |
| false | false | false   |

`or` operator truth table:

| a     | b     | a or b |
| :---- | :---- | :----- |
| true  | true  | true   |
| true  | false | true   |
| false | true  | true   |
| false | false | false  |

## `?:` ternary operator

The `?:` ternary operator is used to create expressions of the form:

`condition ? valueWhenConditionIsTrue : valueWhenConditionIsFalse`

The ternary operator returns a result that depends on the value of `condition`. If it is `true`, then `valueWhenConditionIsTrue` is returned. If `condition` is `false` or `na`, then `valueWhenConditionIsFalse` is returned.

A combination of ternary expressions can be used to achieve the same effect as a `switch` structure, e.g.:

`timeframe.isintraday ? color.red : timeframe.isdaily ? color.green : timeframe.ismonthly`

The example is calculated from left to right:

*   If `timeframe.isintraday` is `true`, then `color.red` is returned. If it is `false`, then `timeframe.isdaily` is evaluated.
*   If `timeframe.isdaily` is `true`, then `color.green` is returned. If it is `false`, then `timeframe.ismonthly` is evaluated.
*   If `timeframe.ismonthly` is `true`, then `color.blue` is returned, otherwise `na` is returned.

Note that the return values on each side of the `:` are expressions - not local blocks, so they will not affect the limit of 500 local blocks per scope.

## `[]` history-referencing operator

It is possible to refer to past values of `time series` using the `[]` history-referencing operator. Past values are values a variable had on bars preceding the bar where the script is currently executing - the current bar. See the `Execution model` page for more information about the way scripts are executed on bars.

The `[]` operator is used after a variable, expression or function call. The value used inside the square brackets of the operator is the offset in the past we want to refer to. To refer to the value of the `volume` built-in variable two bars away from the current bar, one would use `volume[2]`.

Because series grow dynamically, as the script moves on sucessive bars, the offset used with the operator will refer to different bars. Let's see how the value returned by the same offset is dynamic, and why series are very different from arrays. In Pine Script™, the `close` variable, or `close[0]` which is equivalent, holds the value of the current bar's "close". If your code is now executing on the third bar of the dataset (the set of all bars on your chart), `close` will contain the price at the close of that bar, `close[1]` will contain the price at the close of the preceding bar (the dataset's second bar), and `close[2]`, the first bar. `close[3]` will return `na` because no bar exists in that position, and thus its value is not available.

When the same code is executed on the next bar, the fourth in the dataset, `close` will now contain the closing
price of that bar, and the same `close[1]` used in your code will now refer to the "close" of the third bar in the
dataset. The close of the first bar in the dataset will now be `close[3]`, and this time `close[4]` will return `na`.

In the Pine Script ™ runtime environment, as your code is executed once for each historical bar in the dataset, starting
from the left of the chart, Pine Script ™ is adding a new element in the series at index 0 and pushing the pre-existing
elements in the series one index further away. Arrays, in comparison, can have constant or variable sizes, and their
content or indexing structure is not modified by the runtime environment. Pine Script ™ series are thus very different
from arrays and only share familiarity with them through their indexing syntax.

When the market for the chart's symbol is open and the script is executing on the chart's last bar, the `realtime bar`,
`close` returns the value of the current price. It will only contain the actual closing price of the realtime bar the last
time the script is executed on that bar, when it closes.

Pine Script ™ has a variable that contains the number of the bar the script is executing on: `bar_index`. On the first bar,
`bar_index` is equal to 0 and it increases by 1 on each successive bar the script executes on. On the last bar, `bar_index`
is equal to the number of bars in the dataset minus one.

There is another important consideration to keep in mind when using the `[]` operator in Pine Script ™. We have seen
cases when a history reference may return the `na` value. `na` represents a value which is not a number and using it in
any expression will produce a result that is also `na` (similar to `NaN`). Such cases often happen during the script's
calculations in the early bars of the dataset, but can also occur in later bars under certain conditions. If your Pine
Script ™™ code does not explicitly provide for handling these special cases, they can introduce invalid results in your
script's calculations which can ripple through all the way to the realtime bar. The `na` and `nz` functions are designed to
allow for handling such cases.

These are all valid uses of the `[]` operator:

```
high [10]
ta.sma (close, 10)[1]
ta.highest(high, 10)[20]
close > nz(close [1], open)
```

Note that the `[]` operator can only be used once on the same value. This is not allowed:

```
close [1] [2] // Error: incorrect use of [] operator
```

## Operator precedence

The order of calculations is determined by the operators' precedence. Operators with greater precedence are
calculated first. Below is a list of operators sorted by decreasing precedence:

| Precedence | Operator |
|---|---|
| 9 | `[]` |
| 8 | `unary +`, `unary -`, `not` |
| 7 | `*`, `/`, `%` |
| 6 | `+`, `-` |
| 5 | `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` |
| 4 | `==`, `!=` |
| 3 | `and` |
| 2 | `or` |
| 1 | `?:` |

If in one expression there are several operators with the same precedence, then they are calculated left to right.
If the expression must be calculated in a different order than precedence would dictate, then parts of the expression
can be grouped together with parentheses.

## `=` assignement operator
The `=` operator is used to assign a variable when it is initialized — or declared —, i.e., the first time you use it. It
says this is a new variable that I will be using, and I want it to start on each bar with this value.

These are all valid variable declarations:

```
i = 1
MS_IN_ONE_MINUTE = 1000 * 60
showPlotInput = input.bool(true, "Show plots")
pHi = pivothigh(5, 5)
plotColor = color.green
```

See the  page for more information on how to declare variables.

## `:=` reassignement operator
The `:=` is used to reassign a value to an existing variable. It says use this variable that was declared earlier in my
script, and give it a new value.

Variables which have been first declared, then reassigned using `:=`, are called *mutable* variables. All the following
examples are valid variable reassignments. You will find more information on how `var` works in the section on the
.

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
// Declare `pHi`and initilize it on the first bar only.
var float pHi = na
// Reassign a value to `pHi`
pHi := nz(ta.pivothigh (5,5), pHi)
plot(pHi)
```

Note that:
* We declare `pHi` with this code: `var float pHi = na`. The `var` keyword tells Pine Script™ that we only want that variable initialized with `na` on the dataset's first bar. The `float` keyword tells the compiler we are declaring a variable of type "float". This is necessary because, contrary to most cases, the compiler cannot automatically determine the type of the value on the right side of the `=` sign.
* While the variable declaration will only be executed on the first bar because it uses `var`, the `pHi := nz(ta.pivothigh(5, 5), pHi)` line will be executed on all the chart's bars. On each bar, it evaluates if the `pivothigh()` call returns `na` because that is what the function does when it hasn't found a new pivot. The `nz()` function is the one doing the "checking for `na`" part. When its first argument `(ta.pivothigh(5,5))` is `na`, it returns the second argument (`pHi`) instead of the first. When `pivothigh()` returns the price point of a newly found pivot, that value is assigned to `pHi`. When it returns `na` because no new pivot was found, we assign the previous value of `pHi` to itself, in effect preserving its previous value.

The output of our script looks like this:

Note that:
* The line preserves its previous value until a new pivot is found.
* Pivots are detected five bars after the pivot actually occurs because our `ta.pivothigh(5,5)` call says that we require five lower highs on both sides of a high point for it to be detected as a pivot.

See the  section for more information on how to reassign values to variables.

____

*   Introduction
    *   Initialization with `na`

*   Declaration modes
    *   On each bar
    *   `var`

# Introduction

Variables are identifiers that hold values. They must be declared in your code before you use them. The syntax of variable declarations is:

`[<declaration_mode>] [<type>] <identifier> = <expression> | <structure>`

or

`<tuple_declaration> = <function_call> | <structure>`

where:

*   `|` means "or", and parts enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) can appear zero or one time.
*   `<declaration_mode>` is the variable's declaration mode. It can be `var` or `varip`, or nothing.
*   `<type>` is optional, as in almost all Pine Script™ variable declarations (see types).
*   `<identifier>` is the variable's name.
*   `<expression>` can be a literal, a variable, an expression or a function call.
*   `<structure>` can be an `if`, `for`, `while` or `switch` structure.
*   `<tuple_declaration>` is a comma-separated list of variable names enclosed in square brackets (`[]`), e.g., `[ma, upperBand, lowerBand]`.

These are all valid variable declarations. The last one requires four lines:

```pine
BULL_COLOR = color.lime
i = 1
len = input(20, "Length")
float f = 10.5
closeRoundedToTick = math.round_to_mintick(close)
st = ta.supertrend (4, 14)
var barRange = float(na)
var firstBarOpen = open
varip float lastClose = na
[macdLine, signalLine, histLine] = ta.macd(close, 12, 26, 9)
plotColor = if close > open
    color.green
else
    color.red
```

Note
The above statements all contain the `=` assignment operator because they are variable declarations. When you see similar lines using the `:=` reassignment operator, the code is reassigning a value to a variable that was already declared. Those are variable reassignments. Be sure you understand the distinction as this is a common stumbling block for newcomers to Pine Script™. See the next Variable reassignnment section for details.

The formal syntax of a variable declaration is:

```
<variable declaration>
   |
[<declaration mode>] [<type> <identifier> = <expression> | <structure>
<tuple declaration> = <function_call> | <structure>

<declaration_mode>
var varip

<type>
int | float | bool | color | string | line | linefill | label | box | table | array
```

Initialization with `na`
In most cases, an explicit type declaration is redundant because type is automatically inferred from the value on the right of the `=` at compile time, so the decision to use them is often a matter of preference. For example:

```pine
baseLine0 = na           // compile time error!
float baseLinel = na    // OK
baseLine2 = float(na)   // OK
```

In the first line of the example, the compiler cannot determine the type of the `baseLine0` variable because `na` is a generic value of no particular type. The declaration of the `baseLine1` variable is correct because its `float` type is declared explicitly. The declaration of the `baseLine2` variable is also correct because its type can be derived from the expression `float(na)`, which is an explicit cast of the `na` value to the `float` type. The declarations of `baseLine1` and `baseLine2` are equivalent.

Tuple declarations
Function calls or structures are allowed to return multiple values. When we call them and want to store the values they return, a tuple declaration must be used, which is a comma-separated set of one or more values enclosed in brackets. This allows us to declare multiple variables simultaneously. As an example, the `ta.bb()` built-in function for Bollinger bands returns three values:

```pine
[bbMiddle, bbUpper, bbLower] = ta.bb(close, 5, 4)
```

## Variable reassignment

A variable reassignment is done using the `:=` reassignment operator. It can only be done after a variable has been first declared and given an initial value. Reassigning a new value to a variable is often necessary in calculations, and it is always necessary when a variable from the global scope must be assigned a new value from within a structure's local block, e.g.:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
sensitivityInput = input.int(2, "Sensitivity", minval = 1, tooltip = "Higher values sma
ma = ta.sma(close, 20)
maUp = ta.rising(ma, sensitivityInput)
maDn = ta.falling(ma, sensitivityInput)

// On first bar only, initialize color to gray
var maColor = color.gray
if maUp
    // MA has risen for two bars in a row; make it lime.
    maColor := color.lime
else if maDn
    // MA has fallen for two bars in a row; make it fuchsia.
    maColor := color.fuchsia
plot(ma, "MA", maColor, 2)
```

Note that:

*   We initialize `maColor` on the first bar only, so it preserves its value across bars.
*   On every bar, the `if` statement checks if the MA has been rising or falling for the user-specified number of bars
    (the default is 2). When that happens, the value of `maColor` must be reassigned a new value from within the `if`
    local blocks. To do this, we use the `:=` reassignment operator.
*   If we did not use the `:=` reassignment operator, the effect would be to initialize a new `maColor` local variable
    which would have the same name as that of the global scope, but actually be a very confusing independent
    entity that would persist only for the length of the local block, and then disappear without a trace.

All user-defined variables in Pine Script™ are mutable, which means their value can be changed using the `:=`
reassignment operator. Assigning a new value to a variable may change its form (see the page on Pine Script ™'s type
system for more information). A variable can be assigned a new value as many times as needed during the script's
execution on one bar, so a script can contain any number of reassignments of one variable. A variable's declaration
mode determines how new values assigned to a variable will be saved.

## Declaration modes

Understanding the impact that declaration modes have on the behavior of variables requires prior knowledge of Pine
Script ™'s execution model.

When you declare a variable, if a declaration mode is specified, it must come first. Three modes can be used:

*   "On each bar", when none is specified
*   var
*   varip

## On each bar

When no explicit declaration mode is specified, i.e. no `var` or `varip` keyword is used, the variable is declared and initialized on each bar, e.g., the following declarations from our first set of examples in this page's introduction:

```pine
BULL_COLOR = color.lime
i = 1
len = input(20, "Length")
float f = 10.5
closeRoundedToTick = math.round_to_mintick(close)
st = ta.supertrend(4, 14)
[macdLine, signalLine, histLine] = ta.macd(close, 12, 26, 9)
plotColor = if close > open
            color.green
else
    color.red
```

`var`

When the `var` keyword is used, the variable is only initilized once, on the first bar if the declaration is in the global scope, or the first time the local block is executed if the declaration is inside a local block. After that, it will preserve its last value on successive bars, until we reassign a new value to it. This behavior is very useful in many cases where a variable's value must persist through the iterations of a script across successive bars. For example, suppose we'd like to count the number of green bars on the chart:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Green Bars Count")
var count = 0
isGreen = close >= open
if isGreen
    count := count + 1
plot(count)
```

Without the `var` modifier, variable `count` would be reset to zero (thus losing its value) every time a new bar
update triggered a script recalculation.

Declaring variables on the first bar only is often useful to manage drawings more efficiently. Suppoose we want to
extend the last bar's `close` line to the right of the right chart. We could write:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Inefficient version", "", true)
closeLine = line.new(bar_index - 1, close, bar_index, close, extend = extend.right, width = width.auto)
line.delete(closeLine[1])
```

but this is inefficient because we are creating and deleting the line on each historical bar and on each update in the
realtime bar. It is more efficient to use:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Efficient version", "", true)
var closeLine = line.new(bar_index - 1, close, bar_index, close, extend = extend.right, width = width.auto)
if barstate.islast
    line.set_xy1(closeLine, bar_index - 1, close)
    line.set_xy2(closeLine, bar_index, close)
```

Note that:

*   We initialize `closeLine` on the first bar only, using the `var` declaration mode
*   We restrict the execution of the rest of our code to the chart's last bar by enclosing our code that updates the
    line in an `if barstate.islast` structure.

There is a very slight penalty performance for using the `var` declaration mode. For that reason, when declaring
constants, it is preferable not to use `var` if performance is a concern, unless the initialization involves calculations
that take longer than the maintenance penalty, e.g., functions with complex code or string manipulations.

`varip`

Understanding the behavior of variables using the `varip` declaration mode requires prior knowledge of Pine Script ™'s
execution model and bar states.

The `varip` keyword can be used to declare variables that escape the rollback process, which is explained in the page
on Pine Script™'s execution model.

Whereas scripts only execute once at the close of historical bars, when a script is running in realtime, it executes
every time the chart's feed detects a price or volume update. At every realtime update, Pine Script ™'s runtime
normally resets the values of a script's variables to their last committed value, i.e., the value they held when the
previous bar closed. This is generally handy, as each realtime script execution starts from a known state, which
simplifies script logic.

Sometimes, however, script logic requires code to be able to save variable values between different executions in
the realtime bar. Declaring variables with `varip` makes that possible. The "ip" in `varip` stands for intrabar persist.

Let's look at the following code, which does not use `varip`:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("")
int updateNo = na
if barstate.isnew
    updateNo:= 1
else
    updateNo:= updateNo + 1
plot(updateNo, style = plot.style_circles)
```

On historical bars, `barstate.isnew` is always true, so the plot shows a value of "1" because the `else` part of the `if` structure is never executed. On realtime bars, `barstate.isnew` is only `true` when the script first executes on the bar's "open". The plot will then briefly display "1" until subsequent executions occur. On the next executions during the realtime bar, the second branch of the `if` statement is executed because `barstate.isnew` is no longer true. Since `updateNo` is initialized to `na` at each execution, the `updateNo + 1` expression yields `na`, so nothing is plotted on further realtime executions of the script.

If we now use `varip` to declare the `updateNo` variable, the script behaves very differently:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("")
varip int updateNo = na
if barstate.isnew
    updateNo:= 1
else
    updateNo:= updateNo + 1
plot(updateNo, style = plot.style_circles)
```

The difference now is that `updateNo` tracks the number of realtime updates that occur on each realtime bar. This can happen because the `varip` declaration allows the value of `updateNo` to be preserved between realtime updates; it is no longer rolled back at each realtime execution of the script. The test on `barstate.isnew` allows us to reset the update count when a new realtime bar comes in.

Because `varip` only affects the behavior of your code in the realtime bar, it follows that backtest results on strategies designed using logic based on `varip` variables will not be able to reproduce that behavior on historical bars, which will invalidate test results on them. This also entails that plots on historical bars will not be able to reproduce the script's behavior in realtime.

# Conditional structures

- Introduction
- `if` structure
    - `if` used for its side effects
    - `if` used to return a value
- `switch` structure
    - `switch` with an expression
    - `switch` without an expression
- Matching local block type requirement

# Introduction

The conditional structures in Pine Script™ are `if` and `switch`. They can be used:

- For their side effects, i.e., when they don't return a value but do things, like reassign values to variables or call functions.
- To return a value or a tuple which can then be assigned to one (or more, in the case of tuples) variable.

Conditional structures, like the `for` and `while` structures, can be embedded; you can use an `if` or `switch` inside another structure.

Some Pine Script™ built-in functions cannot be called from within the local blocks of conditional structures. They are: `alertcondition()`, `barcolor()`, `fill()`, `hline()`, `indicator()`, `library()`, `plot()`, `plotbar()`, `plotcandle()`, `plotchar()`, `plotshape()`, `strategy()`. This does not entail their functionality cannot be controlled by conditions evaluated by your script - only that it cannot be done by including them in conditional structures. Note that while `input*.()` function calls are allowed in local blocks, their functionality is the same as if they were in the script's global scope.

The local blocks in conditional structures must be indented by four spaces or a tab.

`if` structure

`if` used for its side effects

An `if` structure used for its side effects has the following syntax:

```
if <expression>
<local block>
{else if <expression>
<local_block>}
[else
<local block>]
```

where:

*   Parts enclosed in square brackets ([]) can appear zero or one time, and those enclosed in curly braces ({})
    can appear zero or more times.
*   `<expression>` must be of “bool” type or be auto-castable to that type, which is only possible for "int" or "float"
    values (see the  page).
*   `<local_block>` consists of zero or more statements followed by a return value, which can be a tuple of values. It
    must be indented by four spaces or a tab.
*   There can be zero or more `else if` clauses.
*   There can be zero or one `else` clause.

When the `<expression>` following the `if` evaluates to `true`, the first local block is executed, the `if` structure's execution
ends, and the value(s) evaluated at the end of the local block are returned.

When the `<expression>` following the `if` evaluates to `false`, the successive `else if` clauses are evaluated, if there
are any. When the `<expression>` of one evaluates to `true`, its local block is executed, the `if` structure's execution
ends, and the value(s) evaluated at the end of the local block are returned.

When no `<expression>` has evaluated to `true` and an `else` clause exists, its local block is executed, the `if` structure's
execution ends, and the value(s) evaluated at the end of the local block are returned.

When no `<expression>` has evaluated to `true` and no `else` clause exists, `na` is returned.

Using `if` structures for their side effects can be useful to manage the order flow in strategies, for example. While the
same functionality can often be achieved using the `when` parameter in `strategy.*()` calls, code using `if`
structures is easier to read:

```
if (ta.crossover(source, lower))
    strategy.entry("BBandLE", strategy.long, stop=lower,
      oca_name="BollingerBands",
      oca_type=strategy.oca.cancel, comment="BBandLE")
else
    strategy.cancel(id="BBandLE")
```

Restricting the execution of your code to specific bars ican be done using `if` structures, as we do here to restrict
updates to our label to the chart's last bar:

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
var ourLabel = label.new(bar_index, na, na, color = color (na), textcolor = color.orange)
if barstate.islast
    label.set_xy(ourLabel, bar_index + 2, hl2[1])
    label.set_text(ourLabel, str.tostring(bar_index + 1, "#2 bars in chart"))
```

Note that:

*   We initialize the `ourLabel` variable on the script's first bar only, as we use the `var` declaration mode. The
    value used to initialize the variable is provided by the `label.new()` function call, which returns a label ID pointing
    to the label it creates. We use that call to set the label's properties because once set, they will persist until we
    change them.
*   What happens next is that on each successive bar the Pine Script™ runtime will skip the initialization of
*   ......ourLabel, and the `if` structure's condition (`barstate.islast`) is evaluated. It returns `false` on all bars until
    the last one, so the script does nothing on most historical bars after bar zero.
*   On the last bar, `barstate.islast` becomes `true` and the structure's local block executes, modifying on each chart
    update the properties of our label, which displays the number of bars in the dataset.
*   We want to display the label's text without a background, so we make the label's background `na` in the
    `label.new()` function call, and we use `hl2 [1]` for the label's y position because we don't want it to move all
    the time. By using the average of the previous bar's `high` and `low` values, the label doesn't move until the
    moment when the next realtime bar opens.
*   We use `bar_index + 2` in our `label.set_xy()` call to offset the label to the right by two bars.

`if` used to return a value

An `if` structure used to return one or more values has the following syntax:

```
[<declaration_mode>] [<type>] <identifier> = if <expression>
    <local block>
{else if <expression>
    <local_block>}
[else
    <local block>]
```

where:

*   Parts enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) can appear zero or one time, and those enclosed in curly braces (`{}`)
    can appear zero or more times.
*   `<declaration_mode>` is the variable's 
*   `<type>` is optional, as in almost all Pine Script™ variable declarations (see )
*   `<identifier>` is the variable's 
*   `<expression>` can be a literal, a variable, an expression or a function call.
*   `<local_block>` consists of zero or more statements followed by a return value, which can be a tuple of values. It
    must be indented by four spaces or a tab.
*   The value assigned to the variable is the return value of the `<local_block>`, or `na` if no local block is executed.

This is an example:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
string barState = if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    "islastconfirmedhistory"
else if barstate.isnew
    "isnew"
else if barstate.isrealtime
    "isrealtime"
else
    "other"

f_print(_text) =>
    var table _t = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1)
    table.cell(_t, 0, 0, _text, bgcolor = color.yellow)

f_print(barState)
```

It is possible to omit the `else` block. In this case, if the `condition` is false, an empty value (`na`, `false`, or `""`)
will be assigned to the `var declarationX` variable.

This is an example showing how `na` is returned when no local block is executed. If `close > open` is `false` in here,
`na` is returned:

```
x = if close > open
    close
```

`switch` structure
The `switch` structure exists in two forms. One switches on the different values of a key expression:

```
[[<declaration_mode>] [<type> <identifier> = ]switch <expression>
    {<expression> => <local_block>}
    => <local_block>
```

The other form does not use an expression as a key; it switches on the evaluation of different expressions:

```
[[<declaration_mode>] [<type> <identifier> = ]switch
    {<expression> => <local_block>}
    => <local_block>
```

where:

*   Parts enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) can appear zero or one time, and those enclosed in curly braces (`{}`) can appear zero or more times.
*   `<declaration_mode>` is the variable's 
*   `<type>` is optional, as in almost all Pine Script™ variable declarations (see )
*   `<identifier>` is the variable's 
*   `<expression>` can be a literal, a variable, an expression or a function call.
*   `<local_block>` consists of zero or more statements followed by a return value, which can be a tuple of values. It must be indented by four spaces or a tab.
*   The value assigned to the variable is the return value of the `<local_block>`, or `na` if no local block is executed.
*   The `=> <local block>` at the end allows you to specify a return value which acts as a default to be used when no other case in the structure is executed.

Only one local block of a `switch` structure is executed. It is thus a structured switch that doesn't *fall through* cases. Consequently, `break` statements are unnecessary.

Both forms are allowed as the value used to initialize a variable.

As with the `if` structure, if no local block is exectuted, `na` is returned.

`switch` with an expression
Let's look at an example of a `switch` using an expression:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Switch using an expression", "", true)
string maType
=
input.string("EMA", "MA type", options = ["EMA", "SMA", "RMA", "WMA"])
int maLength = input.int(10, "MA length", minval = 2)
float ma = switch maType
    "EMA" => ta.ema (close, maLength)
    "SMA" => ta.sma (close, maLength)
    "RMA" => ta.rma (close, maLength)
    "WMA" => ta.wma(close, maLength)
    =>
        runtime.error("No matching MA type found.")
        float (na)
plot(ma)
```

Note that:

*   The expression we are switching on is the variable `maType`, which is of "input int" type (see here for an explanation of what the "input" form is). Since it cannot change during the execution of the script, this guarantees that whichever MA type the user selects will be executing on each bar, which is a requirement for functions like `ta.ema()` which require a "simple int" argument for their `length` parameter.
*   If no matching value is found for `maType`, the `switch` executes the last local block introduced by `=>`, which acts as a catch-all. We generate a runtime error in that block. We also end it with `float(na)` so the local block returns a value whose type is compatible with that of the other local blocks in the structure, to avoid a compilation error.

`switch` without an expression

This is an example of a switch structure wich does not use an exppression:

```
//@version=5
strategy("Switch without an expression", "", true)
bool longCondition
= ta.crossover ( ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma (close, 28))
bool shortCondition = ta.crossunder(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma (close, 28))
switch
    longCondition => strategy.entry("Long ID", strategy.long)
    shortCondition => strategy.entry("Short ID", strategy.short)
```

Note that:

*   We are using the `switch` to select the appropriate strategy order to emit, depending on whether the `longCondition` or `shortCondition` "bool" variables are `true`.
*   The building conditions of `longCondition` and `shortCondition` are exclusive. While they can both be `false` simultaneously, they cannot be `true` at the same time. The fact that only one local block of the `switch` structure is ever executed is thus not an issue for us.
*   We evaluate the calls to `ta.crossover()` and `ta.crossunder()` prior to entry in the `switch` structure. Not doing so, as in the following example, would prevent the functions to be executed on each bar, which would result in a compiler warning and erratic behavior:

```
//@version=5
strategy("Switch without an expression", "", true)
switch
    // Compiler warning! Will not calculate correctly!
    ta.crossover(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28)) => strategy.entry("Long ID'
    ta.crossunder(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28)) => strategy.entry("Short II
```

Matching local block type requirement

When multiple local blocks are used in structures, the type of the return value of all its local blocks must match. This
applies only if the structure is used to assign a value to a variable in a declaration, because a variable can only have
one type, and if the statement returns two incompatible types in its branches, the variable type cannot be properly
determined. If the structure is not assigned anywhere, its branches can return different values.

This code compiles fine because `close` and `open` are both of the `float` type:

```
x = if close > open
    close
else
    open
```

This code does not compile because the first local block returns a `float` value, while the second one returns a
`string`, and the result of the `if`-statement is assigned to the `x` variable:

```
// Compilation error!
x = if close > open
    close
else
    "open"
```

# Introduction

## When loops are not needed

Pine Script™'s runtime and its built-in functions make loops unnecessary in many situations. Budding Pine Script™
programmers not yet familiar with the Pine Script™ runtime and built-ins who want to calculate the average of the
last 10 close values will often write code such as:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("Inefficient MA", "", true)
MA_LENGTH = 10
sumOfCloses = 0.0
for offset = 0 to MA_LENGTH - 1
    sumOfCloses := sumOfCloses + close[offset]
inefficientMA = sumOfCloses / MA_LENGTH
plot(inefficientMA)
```

A `for` loop is unnecessary and inefficient to accomplish tasks like this in Pine Script™. This is how it should be done.
This code is shorter and will run much faster because it does not use a loop and uses the `ta.sma()` built-in function to
accomplish the task:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("Efficient MA", "", true)
thePineMA = ta.sma(close, 10)
plot(thePineMA)
```

Counting the occurrences of a condition in the last bars is also a task which beginning Pine Script™ programmers often
think must be done with a loop. To count the number of up bars in the last 10 bars, they will use:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("Inefficient sum")
MA LENGTH = 10
upBars = 0.0
for offset = 0 to MA LENGTH - 1
    if close [offset] > open [offset]
        upBars := upBars + 1
plot(upBars)
```

The efficient way to write this in Pine Script ™ (for the programmer because it saves time, to achieve the fastest-
loading charts, and to share our common resources most equitably), is to use the `math.sum()` built-in function to
accomplish the task:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("Efficient sum")
upBars = math.sum(close > open ? 1 : 0,10)
plot(upBars)
```

What's happening in there is:

*   We use the `?:` ternary operator to build an expression that yields 1 on up bars and 0 on other bars.
*   We use the `math.sum()` built-in function to keep a running sum of that value for the last 10 bars.

## When loops are necessary

Loops exist for good reason because even in Pine Script ™, they are necessary in some cases. These cases typically
include:

*   The manipulation of arrays.
*   Looking back in history to analyze bars using a reference value that can only be known on the current bar, e.g.,
    to find how many past highs are higher than the `high` of the current bar. Since the current bar's `high` is only
    known on the bar the script is running on, a loop is necessary to go back in time and analyze past bars.
*   Performing calculations on past bars that cannot be accomplished using Pine Script™'s built-in functions, like the
    Pearson correlation coefficient.

`for`
The `for` structure allows the repetitive execution of statements using a counter. Its syntax is:

```
[[<declaration_mode>] [<type> <identifier> =]for <identifier> = <expression> to <expression>
<local_block_loop>
```

where:

*   Parts enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) can appear zero or one time, and those enclosed in curly braces (`{}`)
    can appear zero or more times.
*   `<declaration_mode>` is the variable's declaration mode
*   `<type>` is optional, as in almost all Pine Script ™ variable declarations (see [types])
*   `<identifier>` is a variable's name
*   `<expression>` can be a literal, a variable, an expression or a function call.
*   `<local_block_loop>` consists of zero or more statements followed by a return value, which can be a tuple of
    values. It must be indented by four spaces or a tab. It can contain the `break` statement to exit the loop, or the
    `continue` statement to exit the current iteration and continue on with the next.
*   The value assigned to the variable is the return value of the `<local_block_loop>`, i.e., the last value calculated on the loop's last iteration, or `na` if the loop is not executed.
*   The identifier in `for <identifier>` is the loop's counter initial value.
*   The expression in `= <expression>` is the start value of the counter.
*   The expression in `to <expression>` is the end value of the counter. It is only evaluated upon entry in the loop.
*   The expression in `by <expression>` is optional. It is the step by which the loop counter is increased or decreased on each iteration of the loop. Its default value is 1 when `start value < end value`. It is -1 when `start value > end value`. The step (+1 or -1) used as the default is determined by the start and end values.

This example uses a `for` statement to look back a user-defined amount of bars to determine how many bars have a `high` that is higher or lower than the `high` of the last bar on the chart. A `for` loop is necessary here, since the script only has access to the reference value on the chart's last bar. Pine Script™'s runtime cannot, here, be used to calculate on the fly, as the script is executing bar to bar:

```
//@version=5
indicator("`for` loop")
lookbackInput = input.int(50, "Lookback in bars", minval = 1, maxval = 4999)
higherBars = 0
lowerBars = 0
if barstate.islast
    var label lbl = label.new(na, na, "", style = label.style_label_left)
    for i = 1 to lookbackInput
        if high[i] > high
            higherBars += 1
        else if high[i] < high
            lowerBars += 1
    label.set_xy(lbl, bar_index, high)
    label.set_text(lbl, str.tostring(higherBars, "% higher bars\n") + str.tostring(lowerBars, "% lower bars"))
```

This example uses a loop in its `checkLinesForBreaches()` function to go through an array of pivot lines and delete them when price crosses them. A loop is necessary here because all the lines in each of the `hiPivotLines` and `loPivotLines` arrays must be checked on each bar, and there is no Pine Script™ built-in that can do this for us:

```
//@version=5
MAX_LINES_COUNT = 100
indicator("Pivot line breaches", "", true, max_lines_count = MAX_LINES_COUNT)

color hiPivotColorInput = input(color.new(color.lime, 0), "High pivots")
color loPivotColorInput = input(color.new(color.fuchsia, 0), "Low pivots")
int pivotLegsInput = input.int(5, "Pivot legs")
int qtyOfPivotsInput = input.int(50, "Quantity of last pivots to remember", minval = 2)
int maxLineLengthInput = input.int(400, "Maximum line length in bars", minval = 2)

// Queues a new element in an array and de-queues its first element.
qDq (array, qtyOfElements, arrayElement) =>
    array.push(array, arrayElement)
    if array.size(array) > qtyOfElements
        // Only deqeue if array has reached capacity.
        array.shift (array)

// Loop through an array of lines, extending those that price has not crossed an
checkLinesForBreaches(arrayOfLines) =>
    int qtyOfLines = array.size(arrayOfLines)
    // Don't loop in case there are no lines to check because "to" value will be `na`t.
    for lineNo = 0 to (qtyOfLines > 0 ? qtyOfLines - 1 : na)
        // Need to check that array size still warrants a loop because we may have dele
        if lineNo < array.size(arrayOfLines)
            line currentLine = array.get(arrayOfLines, lineNo)
            float lineLevel = line.get_price(currentLine, bar_index)
            bool lineWasCrossed = math.sign(close [1] - lineLevel) != math.sign(close - lineLevel)
            bool lineIsTooLong = bar_index - line.get_x1(currentLine) > maxLineLength
            if lineWasCrossed or lineIsTooLong
                // Line stays on the chart but will no longer be extend on further bars
                array.remove(arrayOfLines, lineNo)
                // Force type of both local blocks to same type.
                int (na)
            else
                line.set_x2 (currentLine, bar_index)
                int (na)

// Arrays of lines containing non-crossed pivot lines.
var line[] hiPivotLines = array.new_line(qtyOfPivotsInput)
var line[] loPivotLines = array.new_line(qtyOfPivotsInput)

// Detect new pivots.
float hiPivot = ta.pivothigh(pivotLegsInput, pivotLegsInput)
float loPivot = ta.pivotlow(pivotLegsInput, pivotLegsInput)

// Create new lines on new pivots.
if not na (hiPivot)
    line newLine = line.new(bar_index [pivotLegsInput], hiPivot, bar_index, hiPivot, hiPivotColorInput, extend = extend.right)
    line.delete(qDq (hiPivotLines, qtyOfPivotsInput, newLine))
else if not na (loPivot)
    line newLine = line.new(bar_index [pivotLegsInput], loPivot, bar_index, loPivot, loPivotColorInput, extend = extend.right)
    line.delete(qDq(loPivotLines, qtyOfPivotsInput, newLine))

// Extend lines if they haven't been crossed by price.
checkLinesForBreaches (hiPivotLines)
checkLinesForBreaches (loPivotLines)
```

`while`
The `while` structure allows the repetitive execution of statements until a condition is false. Its syntax is:

```
[[`<declaration mode>`] [`<type>` `<identifier>` = ]while `<expression>`
`<local_block_loop>`
```

where:
* Parts enclosed in square brackets ([]) can appear zero or one time.
* `<declaration_mode>` is the variable's declaration mode
* `<type>` is optional, as in almost all Pine Script ™ variable declarations (see types)
* `<identifier>` is a variable's name
* `<expression>` can be a literal, a variable, an expression or a function call. It is evaluated at each iteration of the loop. When it evaluates to `true`, the loop executes. When it evaluates to `false` the loop stops. Note that evaluation of the expression is done before each iteration only. Changes to the expression's value inside the loop will only have an impact on the next iteration.
* `<local_block_loop>` consists of zero or more statements followed by a return value, which can be a tuple of values. It must be indented by four spaces or a tab. It can contain the `break` statement to exit the loop, or the `continue` statement to exit the current iteration and continue on with the next.
* The value assigned to the `<identifier>` variable is the return value of the `<local_block_loop>`, i.e., the last value calculated on the loop's last iteration, or `na` if the loop is not executed.

This is the first code example of the `for` section written using a `while` structure instead of a `for` one:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("`for` loop")
lookbackInput = input.int(50, "Lookback in bars", minval = 1, maxval = 4999)
higherBars = 0
lowerBars = 0
if barstate.islast
    var label lbl = label.new(na, na, "", style = label.style_label_left)
    // Initialize the loop counter to its start value.
    i = 1
    // Loop until the `i` counter's value is <= the `lookbackInput` value.
    while i <= lookbackInput
        if high[i] > high
            higherBars += 1
        else if high[i] < high
            lowerBars += 1
        // Counter must be managed "manually".
        i += 1
    label.set_xy(lbl, bar_index, high)
    label.set_text(lbl, str.tostring(higherBars, "% higher bars\n") + str.tostring(lowerBars, "% lower bars"))
```

Note that:
* The `i` counter must be incremented by one explicitly inside the `while`'s local block.
* We use the `+=` operator to add one to the counter. `lowerBars += 1` is equivalent to `lowerBars := lowerBars + 1`.

Let's calculate the factorial function using a `while` structure:

```markdown
//@version=5
indicator("")
```
```
int n = input.int(10, "Factorial of", minval=0)
```
```
factorial(int val = na)
int counter = val
int fact = 1
result = while counter > 0
    fact := fact * counter
    counter := counter - 1
    fact
```
```
// Only evaluate the function on the first bar.
var answer = factorial(n)
plot(answer)
```
Note that:

*   We use `input.int()` for our input because we need to specify a `minval` value to protect our code. While `input()` also supports the input of "int" type values, it does not support the `minval` parameter.

*   We have packaged our script's functionality in a `factorial()` function which accepts as an argument the value whose factorial it must calculate. We have used `int val = na` to declare our function's parameter, which says that if the function is called without an argument, as in `factorial()`, then the `val` parameter will initialize to `na`, which will prevent the execution of the `while` loop because its `counter > 0` expression will return `na`. The `while` structure will thus initialize the `result` variable to `na`. In turn, because the initialization of `result` is the return value of the our function's local block, the function will return `na`.

*   Note the last line of the `while`'s local block: `fact`. It is the local block's return value, so the value it had on the `while` structure's last iteration.

*   Our initialization of `result` is not required; we do it for readability. We could just as well have used:

```
while counter > 0
    fact := fact * counter
    counter := counter - 1
    fact
```

## Introduction

Pine Script ™'s type system is important because it determines what sort of values can be used when calling Pine Script ™ functions, which is a requirement to do pretty much anything in Pine Script ™. While it is possible to write very simple scripts without knowing anything about the type system, a reasonable understanding of it is necessary to achieve any degree of profiency with the language, and in-depth knowledge of its subtleties will allow you to exploit the full potential of Pine Script ™.

The type system uses the *form type* pair to qualify the type of all values, be they literals, a variable, the result of an expression, the value returned by functions or the arguments supplied when calling a function.

The *form* expresses when a value is known.

The *type* denotes the nature of a value.

Note
We will often use "type" to refer to the “form type" pair.

The type system is intimately linked to Pine Script™'s execution model and time series concepts. Understanding all three is key to making the most of the power of Pine Script™.

## Forms
Pine Script™ forms identify when a variable's value is known. They are:
*   "const" for values known at compile time (when adding an indicator to a chart or saving it in the Pine Script™ Editor)
*   "input" for values known at input time (when values are changed in a script's "Settings/Inputs" tab)
*   "simple" for values known at bar zero (when the script begins execution on the chart's first historical bar)
*   "series" for values known on each bar (any time during the execution of a script on any bar)

Forms are organized in the following hierarchy: `const < input < simple < series`, where “const” is considered a weaker form than "input", for example, and "series" stronger than "simple". The form hierarchy translates into the rule that, whenever a given form is required, a weaker form is also allowed.

An expression's result is always of the strongest form used in the expression's calculation. Furthermore, once a variable acquires a stronger form, that state is irreversible; it can never be converted back to a weaker form. A variable of "series” form can thus never be converted back to a "simple" form, for use with a function that requires arguments of that form.

Note that of all these forms, only the "series" form allows values to change dynamically, bar to bar, during the script's execution over each bar of the chart's history. Such values include `close` or `hlc3` or any variable calculated using values of "series" form. Variables of "const", "input" or "simple" forms cannot change values once execution of the script has begun.

## Types
Pine Script™ types identify the nature of a value. They are:
*   The fundamental types: "int", "float", "bool", "color" and "string"
*   The special types: "plot”, “hline”, “line”, “linefill", "label", "box", "table", "array", "matrix"
*   User-defined types (UDTS)
*   "void"

Each fundamental type refers to the nature of the value contained in a variable: `1` is of type "int", `1.0` is of type "float", `"AAPL"` is of type "string", etc. Variables of special types contain an ID referring to an object of the type's name. A variable of type "label" contains an ID (or pointer) referring to a label, and so on. The “void" type means no value is returned.

The Pine Script™ compiler can automatically convert some types into others when a value is not of the required type. The auto-casting rules are: `int` ➡️ `float` ➡️ `bool`. See the  section of this page for more information on type casting.

Except for parameter definitions appearing in function signatures, Pine Script™ forms are implicit in code; they are never declared because they are always determined by the compiler. Types, however, can be specified when declaring variables, e.g.:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
int periodInput = input.int(100, "Period", minval = 2)
float ma = ta.sma(close, periodInput)
bool xUp = ta.crossover (close, ma)
color maColor = close > ma? color.lime : color.fuchsia
plot(ma, "MA", maColor)
plotchar(xUp, "Cross Up", "A", location.top, size = size.tiny)
```

# Using forms and types

## Forms

### const

Values of "const" form must be known at compile time, before your script has access to any information related to the symbol/timeframe information it is running on. Compilation occurs when you save a script in the Pine Script ™ Editor, which doesn't even require it to already be running on your chart. "const” variables cannot change during the execution of a script.

Variables of "const" form can be initialized using a `literal` value, or calculated from expressions using only `literal` values or other variables of "const” form. Our  recommends using upper case `SNAKE_CASE` to name variables of "const” form. While it is not a requirement, "const” variables can be declared using the `var` keyword so they are only initialized on the first bar of the dataset. See the  for more information.

These are examples of literal values:

- literal int: `1, -1, 42`
- literal float: `1., 1.0, 3.14, 6.02E-23, 3e8`
- literal bool: `true, false`
- literal string: `"A text literal"`, `"Embedded single quotes 'text'"`, `'Embedded double quotes "text"'`
- literal color: `#FF55C6, #FF55C6ff`

**Note**

In Pine Script ™, the built-in variables `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`, `time`, `hl2`, `hlc3`, `ohlc4`, etc., are of "series” form because their values can change bar to bar.

The "const" form is a requirement for the arguments to the `title` and `shorttitle` parameters in `indicator()`, for example. All these are valid variables that can be used as arguments for those parameters when calling the function:

```pine
//@version=5
NAME1 = "My indicator"
var NAME2 = "My Indicator"
var NAME3 = "My" + "Indicator"
var NAME4 = NAME2 + " No. 2"
indicator(NAME4, "", true)
plot(close)
```

This will trigger a compilation error:

```pine
//@version=5
var NAME = "My indicator for " + syminfo.type
indicator(NAME, "", true)
plot(close)
```

The reason for the error is that the `NAME` variable's calculation depends on the value of `syminfo.type` which is a "simple string" (`syminfo.type` returns a string corresponding to the sector the chart's symbol belongs to, eg., "crypto", "forex", etc.).

Note that using the `:=` operator to assign a new value to a previously declared "const” variable will transform it into a "simple" variable, e.g., here with `name1`, for which we do not use an uppercase name because it is not of "const" form:

```pine
var namel = "My Indicator "
var NAME2 = "No. 2"
namel := name1 + NAME2
```

### input
Values of "input" form are known when the values initialized through `input.*()` functions are determined. These functions determine the values that can be modified by script users in the script's "Settings/Inputs" tab. When these values are changed, this always triggers a re-execution of the script from the beginning of the chart's history (bar zero), so variables of "input" form are always known when the script begins execution, and they do not change during the script's execution.

Note
The `input.source()` function yields a value of "series” type – not "input". This is because built-in variables such as `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `hl2`, `hlc3`, `ohlc4`, etc., are of "series” form.

The script plots the moving average of a user-defined source and period from a symbol and timeframe also determined through inputs:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
symbolInput = input.symbol("AAPL", "Symbol")
timeframeInput = input.timeframe("D", "Timeframe")
sourceInput = input.source(close, "Source")
periodInput = input(10, "Period")
v = request.security(symbolInput, timeframeInput, ta.sma(sourceInput, periodInput))
plot(v)
```

Note that:

*   The `symbolInput`, `timeframeInput` and `periodInput` variables are of "input" form.
*   The `sourceInput` variable is of "series" form because it is determined from a call to `input.source()`.
*   Our `request.security()` call is valid because its `symbol` and `timeframe` parameters require a “simple" argument and the "input" form we use is weaker than "simple”. The function's `expression` parameter requires a "series” form argument, and that is what form our `sourceInput` variable is. Note that because a "series" form is required there, we could have used "const", "input" or "simple" forms as well.
*   As per our style guide's recommendations, we use the "Input" suffix with our input variables to help readers of our code remember the origin of these variables.

Wherever an "input" form is required, a "const" form can also be used.

### simple
Values of "simple" form are known only when a script begins execution on the first bar of a chart's history, and they
never change during the execution of the script. Built-in variables of the `syminfo.*`, `timeframe.*` and
`ticker.*` families, for example, all return results of "simple" form because their value depends on the chart's
symbol, which can only be detected when the script executes on it.

A "simple” form argument is also required for the `length` argument of functions such as `ta.ema()` or `ta.rma()` which
cannot work with dynamic lengths that could change during the script's execution.

Wherever a "simple” form is required, a "const” or “input" form can also be used.

### series
Values of "series" form (also sometimes called `dynamic`) provide the most flexibility because they can change on any
bar, or even multiples times during the same bar, in loops for example. Built-in variables such as `open`, `close`, `high`,
`time` or `volume` are of "series" form, as would be the result of expressions calculated using them. Functions such as
`barssince()` or `crossover()` yield a result of "series” form because it varies bar to bar, as does that of the `[]` history-
referencing operator used to access past values of a time series. While the "series” form is the most common form
used in Pine Script™, it is not always allowed as arguments to Pine Script™ built-in functions.

Suppose you want to display the value of pivots on your chart. This will require converting values into strings, so the
string values your code will be using will be of "series string" type. Pine Script ™'s `label.new()` function can be used to
place such "series string” text on the chart because its `text` parameter accepts arguments of “series" form:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
pivotBarsInput = input(3)
hip = ta.pivothigh (high, pivotBarsInput, pivotBarsInput)
if not na(hip)
    label.new(bar_index[pivotBarsInput], hip, str.tostring(hip, format.mintick),
      style = label.style_label_down,
      color = na,
      textcolor = color.silver)
plotchar (hip, "hip", ".", location.top, size = size.tiny)
```

Note that:

*   The `str.tostring(hip, format.mintick)` call we use to convert the pivot's value to a string yields a "series string" result, which will work with `label.new()`.
*   While prices appear at the pivot, the pivots actually require `pivotBarsInput` bars to have elapsed before they can be detected. Pivot prices only appear on the pivot because we plot them in the past after the pivot's detection, using `bar_index[pivotBarsInput]` (the `bar_index`'s value, offset `pivotBarsInput` bars back). In real time, these prices would only appear `pivotBarsInput` bars after the actual pivot.
*   We print a blue dot using `plotchar()` when a pivot is detected in our code.
*   Pine Script™'s `plotshape()` can also be used to position text on the chart, but because its `text` parameter requires a "const string" argument, we could not have used it in place of `label.new()` in our script.

Wherever a "series" form is required, a "const", "input" or "simple” form can also be used.

# Types
## int
Integer literals must be written in decimal notation, e.g.:

```
1
-1
750
```

Built-in variables such as `bar_index`, `time`, `timenow`, `time_close`, or `dayofmonth` all return values of type "int".

## float

Floating-point literals contain a delimiter (the symbol `.`) and may also contain the symbol `e` or `E` (which means "multiply by 10 to the power of X", where X is the number after the symbol `e`), e.g.:

```
3.14159   // Rounded value of Pi (п)
3.0
6.02e23   // 6.02 * 10^23 (a very large value)
1.6e-19   // 1.6 * 10^-19 (a very small value)
```

The internal precision of floats in Pine Script™ is 1e-10.

## bool

There are only two literals representing bool values:

```
true  // true value
false // false value
```

When an expression of type “bool" returns `na` and it is used to test a conditional statement or operator, the "false" branch is executed.

## color

Color literals have the following format: `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA`. The letter pairs represent `00` to `FF` hexadecimal values (0 to 255 in decimal) where:

*   `RR`, `GG` and `BB` pairs are the values for the color's red, green and blue components
*   `AA` is an optional value for the color's transparency (or alpha component) where `00` is invisible and `FF` opaque. When no `AA` pair is supplied, `FF` is used.
*   The hexadecimal letters can be upper or lower case

Examples:

```
#000000  // black color
#FF0000  // red color
#00FF00  // green color
#0000FF  // blue color
#FFFFFF  // white color
#808080  // gray color
#3ff7a0  // some custom color
#FF000080  // 50% transparent red color
#FF0000ff  // same as #FF0000, fully opaque red color
#FF000000  // completely transparent color
```

Pine Script™ also has built-in color constants such as `color.green`, `color.red`, `color.orange`, `color.blue` (the default color used in `plot()` and other plotting functions), etc.

When using color built-ins, is possible to add transparency information to them with `color.new`.

Note that when specifying red, green or blue components in `color.*()` functions, a 0-255 decimal value must be
used. When specifying transparency in such functions, it is in the form of a 0-100 value (which can be of "float" type
to access the underlying 255 potential valoues) where the scale 00-FF scale for color literals is inverted: 100 is thus
invisible and O is opaque.
Here is an example:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Shading the chart's background", "", true)
BASE_COLOR = color.navy
bgColor = dayofweek == dayofweek.monday    ? color.new(BASE_COLOR, 50) :
          dayofweek == dayofweek.tuesday   ? color.new(BASE_COLOR, 60) :
          dayofweek == dayofweek.wednesday ? color.new(BASE_COLOR, 70) :
          dayofweek == dayofweek.thursday  ? color.new(BASE_COLOR, 80) :
          dayofweek == dayofweek.friday    ? color.new(BASE_COLOR, 90):
          color.new(color.blue, 80)
bgcolor(bgColor)
```

See the page on colors for more information on using colors in Pine Script™.

### string
String literals may be enclosed in single or double quotation marks, e.g.:

```
"This is a double quoted string literal"
'This is a single quoted string literal'
```

Single and double quotation marks are functionally equivalent. A string enclosed within double quotation marks may
contain any number of single quotation marks, and vice versa:

```
"It's an example"
'The "Star" indicator'
```

You can escape the string's delimiter in the string by using a backslash. For example:

```
'It\'s an example'
"The \"Star\" indicator"
```

You can concatenate strings using the + operator.

### plot and hline
Pine Script ™'s `fill()` function fills the space between two lines with a color. Both lines must have been plotted with
either `plot()` or `hline()` function calls. Each plotted line is referred to in the `fill()` function using IDs which are of "plot"
or "hline" type, e.g.:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
plotID1 = plot(high)
plotID2 = plot(math.max(close, open))
fill(plotID1, plotID2, color.yellow)
```

Note that there is no `plot` or `hline` keyword to explicitly declare the type of `plot()` or `hline()` IDs.

### line, linefill, label, box and table
Drawings appeared in Pine Script ™ starting with v4. Each drawing has its own type: line, linefill, label, box, table.
Each type is also used as a namespace containing all the built-in functions used to operate on each type of drawing.
One of these is a new() constructor used to create an object of that type: line.new(), linefill.new(), label.new(),
box.new() and table.new().
These functions all return an ID which is a reference that uniquely identifies a drawing object. IDs are always of
"series" form, thus their form and type is "series line", "series label", etc. Drawing IDs act like a pointer in that they
are used to reference a specific instance of a drawing in all the functions of that drawing's namespace. For example,
the line ID returned by a line.new() call will then be used to refer to it when comes time to delete the line using
line.delete().

### Arrays and matrices
Arrays and matrices in Pine Script ™ are identified by an ID, much like drawings such as lines. The type of the ID
defines the type of elements contained in the array or matrix. Array and matrix types are specified by appending a
type template to the array or matrix keywords:

*   `array<int>` defines an array containing "int" elements.
*   `array<label>` defines an array containing "label" IDs.
*   `array<UDF>` defines an array containing objects of a user-defined type (UDT).
*   `matrix<float>` defines a matrix containing “float” elements.
*   `matrix<UDF>` defines a matrix containing objects of a user-defined type (UDT).

An array containing elements of type "int" initalized with one element of value 10 can be declared in the following,
equivalent ways:

```
a1 = array.new<int>(1, 10)
array<int> a2 = array.new<int>(1, 10)
a3 = array.from(10)
array<int> a4 = array.from(10)
```

Note that the `int[]` syntax can also be used to declare an array of "int" elements, but that use is discouraged. No
equivalent exists to specify the type of matrices in that way. Also note that type-specific built-ins such as
`array.new_int()` also exist, but the more generic `array.new<type>` form is preferred, which would be
`array.new<int>()` to create an array of "int" elements.

### User-defined types
The `type` keyword allows the creation of user-defined types (UDTs) from which objects can be created. UDTs are
composite types; they contain an arbitrary number of fields that can be of any type. The syntax to define a user-
defined type is:

```
type <UDT_identifier>
    [export] <field_type> <field name> [= <value>]
    ...
```

where:
*   `export` is used to export the UDT from a library. See the  page for more information.
*   `<UDT_identifier>` is the name of the user-defined type.
*   `<field_type>` is the type of the field.
*   `<field name>` is the name of the field.
*   `<value>` is an optional default value for the field, which will be assigned to it when new objects of that UDT
    are created. The field's default value will be `na` if none is specified. The same rules as those governing the
    default values of parameters in function signatures apply to the default values of fields. For example, the `[]`
    history-referencing operator cannot be used with them, and expressions are not allowed.

In this example, we create a UDT containing two fields to hold pivot information, the `time` of the pivot's bar and its
price level:

```pine
type pivot Point
    int openTime
    float level
```

User-defined types can be embedded, so a field can be of the same type as the UDT it belongs to. Here, we add a field to our previous `pivot Point` type that will hold the pivot information for another pivot point:

```pine
type pivot Point
    int openTime
    float level
    pivotPoint nextPivot
```

Two built-in methods can be used with a UDT: `new()` and `copy()`. Read about them in the  page.

### void

There is a "void" type in Pine Script™. Functions having only side-effects and returning no usable result return the "void" type. An example of such a function is `alert()`; it does something (triggers an alert event), but it returns no useful value.

A "void" result cannot be used in an expression or assigned to a variable. No `void` keyword exists in Pine Script™, as variables cannot be declared using the “void" type.

### `na` value

In Pine Script™ there is a special value called `na`, which is an acronym for *not available*, meaning the value of an expression or variable is undefined. It is similar to the `null` value in Java, or `None` in Python.

`na` values can be automatically cast to almost any type. In some cases, however, the Pine Script™ compiler cannot automatically infer a type for an `na` value because more than one automatic type-casting rule can be applied. For example:

```pine
// Compilation error!
myVar = na
```

Here, the compiler cannot determine if `myVar` will be used to plot something, as in `plot(myVar)` where its type would be "float", or to set some text as in `label.set_text(lb, text = myVar)` where its type would be "string", or for some other purpose. Such cases must be explicitly resolved in one of two ways:

```pine
float myVar = na
```

or

```pine
myVar = float(na)
```

To test if some value is `na`, a special function must be used: `na()`. For example:

```pine
myClose = na(myVar) ? 0 : close
```

Do not use the `==` operator to test for `na` values, as this method is unreliable.

Designing your calculations so they are `na`-resistant is often useful. In this example, we define a condition that is
true when the bar's `close` is higher than the previous one. For this calculation to work correctly on the dataset's
first bar where no previous close exists and `close[1]` will return `na`, we use the `nz()` function to replace it with the
current bar's `open` for that special case:

```pine
bool risingClose = close > nz(close[1], open)
```

Protecting against `na` values can also be useful to prevent an initial `na` value from propagating in a calculation's result
on all bars. This happens here because the initial value of `ath` is `na`, and `math.max()` returns `na` if one of its
arguments is `na`:

```pine
// Declare `ath` and initialize it with `na` on the first bar.
var float ath = na
// On all bars, calculate the maximum between the `high` and the previous value of `ath
ath := math.max(ath, high)
```

To protect against this, we could instead use:

```pine
var float ath = na
ath := math.max(nz(ath), high)
```

where we are replacing any `na` values of `ath` with zero. Even better would be:

```pine
var float ath = high
ath := math.max(ath, high)
```

## Type templates
Type templates are used to build array and matrix types. They are a type name enclosed in angle brackets, for
example: `<int>`, `<label>`, `<pivotPoint>` (where `pivotPoint` is a ). Type templates
can be constructed from:

- Fundamental types: "int", "float", "bool", "color" and "string"
- The following special types: “line”, “linefill”, “label”, “box”, “table”
- 

They can be used to declare the type of a variable and in the `array.new<type>` or `matrix.new<type>` function calls
used to create a new array or matrix:

```pine
// Declare an empty array variable.
var array<int> a = na
// Create an array of 10 "int" elements.
var a = array.new<int>(10)
```

## Type casting

There is an automatic type-casting mechanism in Pine Script™ which can cast (or convert) certain types to another.
The auto-casting rules are: "int" ➡️ "float" ➡️ "bool", which means that when a "float" is required, an "int"
can be used in its place, and when a "bool" value is required, an "int" or "float" value can be used in its place.
See auto-casting in action in this code:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("")
plotshape (close)
```

Note that:
* plotshape() requires a "series bool” argument for its first parameter named `series`. The `true`/`false` value of that "bool" argument determines if the function plots a shape or not.
* We are here calling plotshape() with `close` as its first argument. This would not be allowed without Pine's auto-casting rules, which allow a "float" to be cast to a "bool". When a "float" is cast to a “bool", any non-zero values are converted to `true`, and zero values are converted to `false`. As a result of this, our code will plot an "X" on all bars, as long as `close` is not equal to zero.

It may sometimes be necessary to cast one type into another because auto-casting rules will not suffice. For these cases, explicit type-casting functions exist. They are: `int()`, `float()`, `bool()`, `color()`, `string()`, `line()`, `linefill()`, `label()`, `box()`, and `table()`.

This is code that will not compile because we fail to convert the type of the argument used for `length` when calling `ta.sma()`:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("")
len = 10.0
s = ta.sma(close, len) // Compilation error!
plot(s)
```

The code fails to compile with the following error: `Cannot call 'ta.sma` with argument 'length'='len'. An argument of 'const float' type was used but a 'series int' is expected. The compiler is telling us that we supplied a "float" value where an "int" is required. There is no auto-casting rule that can automatically cast a "float" to an "int", so we will need to do the job ourselves. For this, we will use the `int()` function to force the type conversion of the value we supply as a length to `ta.sma()` from "float" to "int":

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("")
len = 10.0
s = ta.sma(close, int(len))
plot(s)
```

Explicit type-casting can also be useful when declaring variables and initializing them to `na` which can be done in two ways:

```pine
// Cast `na` to the "label" type.
lbl = label (na)
// Explicitly declare the type of the new variable.
label lbl = na
```

## Tuples

A tuple is a comma-separated set of expressions enclosed in brackets that can be used when a function or a local block must return more than one variable as a result. For example:

```pine
calcSumAndMult(a, b) =>
    sum = a + b
    mult = a * b
    [sum, mult]
```

In this example there is a two-element tuple on the last statement of the function's code block, which is the result returned by the function. Tuple elements can be of any type. There is also a special syntax for calling functions that return tuples, which uses a tuple declaration on the left side of the equal sign in what is a multi-variable declaration. The result of a function such as `calcSumAndMult()` that returns a tuple must be assigned to a tuple declaration, i.e., a set of comma-separated list of new variables that will receive the values returned by the function. Here, the value of the `sum` and `mult` variables calculated by the function will be assigned to the `s` and `m` variables:

`[s, m] = calcSumAndMul(high, low)`

Note that the type of `s` and `m` cannot be explicitly defined; it is always inferred by the type of the function return results.

Tuples can be useful to request multiple values in one `request.security()` call:

```pine
roundedOHLC() =>
    [math.round_to_mintick(open), math.round_to_mintick(high), math.round_to_mintick(low), math.round_to_mintick(close)]
[op, hi, lo, cl] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", roundedOHLC())
```

or:

```pine
[op, hi, lo, cl] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", [math.round_to_mintick(open), math.round_to_mintick(high), math.round_to_mintick(low), math.round_to_mintick(close)])
```

or this form if no rounding is required

```pine
[op, hi, lo, cl] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", [open, high, low, close])
```

Tuples can also be used as return results of local blocks, in an `if` statement for example:

```pine
[v1, v2] = if close > open
    [high, close]
else
    [close, low]
```

They cannot be used in ternaries, however, because the return values of a ternary statement are not considered as local blocks. This is not allowed:

```pine
// Not allowed.
[v1, v2] = close > open ? [high, close] : [close, low]
```

Please note that the items within a tuple returned from a function may be of simple or series form, depending on its contents. If a tuple contains a series value, all other elements within the tuple will also be of the series form. For example:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("tuple_typeforms")

makeTicker(simple string prefix, simple string ticker) =>
    tId = prefix + ":" + ticker // simple string
    source = close                // series float
    [tId, source]

// Both variables are series now.
[tId, source] = makeTicker("BATS", "AAPL")

// Error cannot call 'request.security' with 'series string' tId.
r = request.security(tId, "", source)
plot(r)
```

# Built-ins
* Introduction
* Built-in variables
* Built-in functions

## Introduction
Pine Script ™ has hundreds of built-in variables and functions. They provide your scripts with valuable information and
make calculations for you, dispensing you from coding them. The better you know the Pine Script ™ built-ins, the more
you will be able to do with your Pine scripts.
In this page we present an overview of some of Pine Script™'s built-in variables and functions. They will be covered in
more detail in the pages of this manual covering specific themes.
All Pine Script™ built-in variables and functions are defined in the Pine Script ™ v5 Reference Manual. It is called a
"Reference Manual" because it is the definitive reference on the Pine Script ™ language. It is an essential tool that
will accompany you anytime you code in Pine Script ™, whether you are a beginner or an expert. If you are learning
your first programming language, make the Reference Manual your friend. Ignoring it will make your programming
experience with Pine Script ™ difficult and frustrating as it would with any other programming language.
Variables and functions in the same family share the same namespace, which is a prefix to the function's name. The
`ta.sma()` function, for example, is in the `ta` namespace, which stands for "technical analysis". A namespace can
contain both variables and functions.
Some variables have function versions as well, e.g.:
* The `ta.tr` variable returns the "True Range" of the current bar. The `ta.tr(true)` function call also returns the
"True Range", but when the previous `close` value which is normally needed to calculate it is `na`, it calculates
using `high - low` instead.
* The `time` variable gives the time at the `open` of the current bar. The `time(timeframe)` function returns the time
of the bar's `open` from the `timeframe` specified, even if the chart's timeframe is different. The
`time(timeframe, session)` function returns the time of the bar's `open` from the `timeframe` specified, but only
if it is within the `session` time. The `time(timeframe, session, timezone)` function returns the time of the bar's
`open` from the `timeframe` specified, but only if it is within the `session` time in the specified `timezone`.

## Built-in variables
Built-in variables exist for different purposes. These are a few examples:
* Price- and volume-related variables: `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `hl2`, `hlc3`, `ohlc4`, and `volume`.
* Symbol-related information in the `syminfo` namespace: `syminfo.basecurrency`, `syminfo.currency`,
`syminfo.description`, `syminfo.mintick`, `syminfo.pointvalue`, `syminfo.prefix`, `syminfo.root`, `syminfo.session`,
`syminfo.ticker`, `syminfo.tickerid`, `syminfo.timezone`, and `syminfo.type`.
* Timeframe (a.k.a. "interval” or “resolution", e.g., 15sec, 30min, 60min, 1D, 3M) variables in the `timeframe`
namespace: timeframe.isseconds, timeframe.isminutes, timeframe.isintraday, timeframe.isdaily,
timeframe.isweekly, timeframe.ismonthly, timeframe.isdwm, timeframe.multiplier, and timeframe.period.
* Bar states in the `barstate` namespace (see the Bar states page): barstate.isconfirmed, barstate.isfirst,
barstate.ishistory, barstate.islast, barstate.islastconfirmedhistory, barstate.isnew, and barstate.isrealtime.
* Strategy-related information in the `strategy` namespace: strategy.equity, strategy.initial_capital,
strategy.grossloss, strategy.grossprofit, strategy.wintrades, strategy.losstrades, strategy.position_size,
strategy.position_avg_price, strategy.wintrades, etc.

## Built-in functions

Many functions are used for the result(s) they return. These are a few examples:
* Math-related functions in the `math` namespace: math.abs(), math.log(), math.max(), math.random(),
math.round_to_mintick(), etc.
* Technical indicators in the `ta` namespace: ta.sma(), ta.ema(), ta.macd(), ta.rsi(), ta.supertrend(), etc.
* Support functions often used to calculate technical indicators in the `ta` namespace: ta.barssince(),
ta.crossover(), ta.highest(), etc.
* Functions to request data from other symbols or timeframes in the `request` namespace: request.dividends(),
request.earnings(), request.financial(), request.quandl(), request.security(), request.splits().
* Functions to manipulate strings in the `str` namespace: str.format(), str.length(), str.tonumber(), str.tostring(),
etc.
* Functions used to define the input values that script users can modify in the script's "Settings/Inputs" tab, in
the `input` namespace: input(), input.color(), input.int(), input.session(), input.symbol(), etc.
* Functions used to manipulate colors in the `color` namespace: color.from_gradient(), color.new(), color.rgb(),
etc.

Some functions do not return a result but are used for their side effects, which means they do something, even if they
don't return a result:
* Functions used as a declaration statement defining one of three types of Pine scripts, and its properties. Each
script must begin with a call to one of these functions: indicator(), strategy() or library().
* Plotting or coloring functions: bgcolor(), plotbar(), plotcandle(), plotchar(), plotshape(), fill().
* Strategy functions placing orders, in the `strategy` namespace: strategy.cancel(), strategy.close(),
strategy.entry(), strategy.exit(), strategy.order(), etc.
* Strategy functions returning information on indivdual past trades, in the `strategy` namespace:
strategy.closedtrades.entry_bar_index(), strategy.closedtrades.entry_price(),
strategy.closedtrades.entry_time(), strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index(),
strategy.closedtrades.max_drawdown(), strategy.closedtrades.max_runup(), strategy.closedtrades.profit(), etc.
* Functions to generate alert events: alert() and alertcondition().

Other functions return a result, but we don't always use it, e.g.: hline(), plot(), array.pop(), label.new(), etc.

All Pine Script ™ built-in functions are defined in the Pine Script ™ v5 Reference Manual. You can click on any of the
function names listed here to go to its entry in the Reference Manual, which documents the function's signature, i.e.,
the list of parameters it accepts and the form-type of the value(s) it returns (a function can return more than one
result). The Reference Manual entry will also list, for each parameter:
* Its name.
* The form-type of the value it requires (we use `argument` to name the values passed to a function when calling
it).
* If the parameter is required or not.

All built-in functions have one or more parameters defined in their signature. Not all parameters are required for
every function.

Let's look at the `ta.vwma()` function, which returns the volume-weighted moving average of a source value. This is its entry in the Reference Manual:



The entry gives us the information we need to use it:

* What the function does.

* Its signature (or definition):

    `ta.vwma(source, length) series float`

* The parameters it includes: `source` and `length`

* The form and type of the result it returns: "series float".

* An example showing it in use: `plot(ta.vwma(close, 15))`.

* An example showing what it does, but in long form, so you can better understand its calculations. Note that this is meant to explain not as usable code, because it is more complicated and takes longer to execute. There are only disadvantages to using the long form.

* The "RETURNS" section explains exacty what value the function returns.

* The "ARGUMENTS" section lists each parameter and gives the critical information concerning what form-type is required for arguments used when calling the function.

* The "SEE ALSO" section refers you to related Reference Manual entries.

This is a call to the function in a line of code that declares a `myVwma` variable and assigns the result of `ta.vwma(close, 20)` to it:

`myVwma = ta.vwma(close, 20)`

Note that:

* We use the built-in variable `close` as the argument for the `source` parameter.
* We use `20` as the argument for the `length` parameter.

* If placed in the global scope (i.e., starting in a line's first position), it will be executed by the Pine Script ™
runtime on each bar of the chart.
We can also use the parameter names when calling the function. Parameter names are called keyword arguments
when used in a function call:

```
myVwma = ta.vwma(source = close, length = 20)
```

You can change the position of arguments when using keyword arguments, but only if you use them for all your
arguments. When calling functions with many parameters such as `indicator()`, you can also forego keyword arguments
for the first arguments, as long as you don't skip any. If you skip some, you must then use keyword arguments so the
Pine Script ™ compiler can figure out which parameter they correspond to, e.g.:

```
indicator("Example", "Ex", true, max_bars_back = 100)
```

Mixing things up this way is not allowed:

```
indicator(precision = 3, "Example") // Compilation error!
```

When calling Pine Script™ built-ins, it is critical to ensure that the arguments you use are of the form and type
required, which will vary for each parameter.

To learn how to do this, one needs to understand Pine Script™'s . The Reference Manual entry for each
built-in function includes an “ARGUMENTS” section which lists the form-type required for the argument supplied to
each of the function's parameters.

Introduction

User-defined functions are functions that you write, as opposed to the built-in functions in Pine Script ™. They are useful to define calculations that you must do repetitevely, or that you want to isolate from your script's main section of calculations. Think of user-defined functions as a way to extend the capabilities of Pine Script ™, when no built-in function will do what you need.

You can write your functions in two ways:

*   In a single line, when they are simple, or
*   On multiple lines

Functions can be located in two places:

*   If a function is only used in one script, you can include it in the script where it is used. See our  for recommendations on where to place functions in your script.
*   You can create a  to include your functions, which makes them reusable in other scripts without having to copy their code. Distinct requirements exist for library functions. They are explained in the page on .

Whether they use one line or multiple lines, user-defined functions have the following characteristics:

*   They cannot be embedded. All functions are defined in the script's global scope.
*   They do not support recursion. It is not allowed for a function to call itself from within its own code.
*   The type of the value returned by a function is determined automatically and depends on the type of arguments used in each particular function call.
*   Each function call

Single-line functions

Simple functions can often be written in one line. This is the formal definition of single-line functions:

`<function declaration>`
``<identifier>(<parameter_list>) => <return_value>``

`<parameter_list>`
``{<parameter_definition>{, <parameter_definition>}}``

`<parameter definition>`
``[<identifier> = <default value>]``

`<return value>`
``<statement> | <expression> | <tuple>``

Here is an example:

`f(x, y) => x + y`

After the function `f()` has been declared, it's possible to call it using different types of arguments:

```
a = f(open, close)
b = f(2, 2)
c = f(open, 2)
```

In the example above, the type of variable `a` is series because the arguments are both series. The type of variable `b` is integer because arguments are both literal integers. The type of variable `c` is series because the addition of a series and literal integer produces a series result.

## Multi-line functions

Pine Script™ also supports multi-line functions with the following syntax:

`<identifier>(<parameter_list>)`
`<local block>`
``<identifier>(<list of parameters>) =>``
`<variable declaration>`
`...`
`<variable declaration or expression>`

where:

`<parameter list>`
``{<parameter_definition>{, <parameter_definition>}}``

`<parameter_definition>`
``[<identifier> = <default_value>]``

The body of a multi-line function consists of several statements. Each statement is placed on a separate line and must be preceded by 1 indentation (4 spaces or 1 tab). The indentation before the statement indicates that it is a part of the body of the function and not part of the script's global scope. After the function's code, the first statement without an indent indicates the body of the function has ended.

Either an expression or a declared variable should be the last statement of the function's body. The result of this expression (or variable) will be the result of the function's call. For example:

```text
geom_average(x, y) =>
    a = x*x
    b = y*y
    math.sqrt(a + b)
```

The function `geom_average` has two arguments and creates two variables in the body: `a` and `b`. The last
statement calls the function `math.sqrt` (an extraction of the square root). The `geom_average` call will return the
value of the last expression: `(math.sqrt(a + b))`.

## Scopes in the script

Variables declared outside the body of a function or of other local blocks belong to the global scope. User-declared
and built-in functions, as well as built-in variables also belong to the global scope.

Each function has its own local scope. All the variables declared within the function, as well as the function's
arguments, belong to the scope of that function, meaning that it is impossible to reference them from outside — e.g.,
from the global scope or the local scope of another function.

On the other hand, since it is possible to refer to any variable or function declared in the global scope from the scope
of a function (except for self-referencing recursive calls), one can say that the local scope is embedded into the
global scope.

In Pine Script™, nested functions are not allowed, i.e., one cannot declare a function inside another one. All user
functions are declared in the global scope. Local scopes cannot intersect with each other.

## Functions that return multiple results

In most cases a function returns only one result, but it is possible to return a list of results (a tuple-like result):

```
fun(x, y) =>
    a = x+y
    b = x-y
    [a, b]
```

Special syntax is required for calling such functions:

```
[res0, res1] = fun(open, close)
plot(res0)
plot(res1)
```

## Limitations

User-defined functions can use any of the Pine Script™ built-ins, except: `barcolor()`, `fill()`, `hline()`, `indicator()`,
`library()`, `plot()`, `plotbar()`, `plotcandle()`, `plotchar()`, `plotshape()` and `strategy()`.

## Introduction

Arrays can be used to store multiple values in one data structure. Think of them as a better way to handle cases
where you would otherwise need a set of variables named `price00`, `price01` and `price02`. Arrays are an
advanced feature used for scripts requiring intricate data-handling. If you are a beginning Pine Script™ programmer,
we recommend you become familiar with other, more accessible Pine Script™ features before you tackle arrays.

Pine Script™ arrays are one-dimensional. All elements of an array are of the same type, which can be "int", "float",
"bool", "color", "string", "line", "label", "box" or "table", always of "series” form. Arrays are referenced using an
array ID similar to line or label IDs. Pine Script ™ does not use an indexing operator to reference individual array
elements; instead, functions like `array.get()` and `array.set()` are used to read and write values of array elements.
Array values can be used in all Pine Script™ expressions and functions where a value of "series" form is allowed.

Elements within an array are referred to using an index, which starts at 0 and extends to the number or elements in
the array, minus one. Arrays in Pine Script ™ can be sized dynamically, so the number of elements in the array can be
modified within one iteration of the script on a bar, and vary across bars. Multiple arrays can be used in the same
script. The size of arrays is limited to 100,000.

Note
We will use beginning of an array to designate index 0, and end of an array to designate the array's element
with the highest index value. We will also extend the meaning of array to include array IDs, for the sake of
brevity.

## Declaring arrays

The following syntax can be used to declare arrays:

```
<type>[] <identifier> = <expression>
var <type>[] <identifier> = <expression>
array<type> <identifier> = <expression>
var array<type> <identifier> = <expression>
```

The `[]` modifier (not to be confused with the `[]` history-referencing operator) is appended to the type name when
declaring arrays. However, since type-specific functions are always used to create arrays, the `<type>[]` part of the
declaration is redundant, except if you initialize an array variable to `na`. Explicitly declaring the array type helps
state our intention to readers more clearly.

In the following example, we declare an array variable named `prices` and initialize it with `na`. Consequently, its
type must be specified. The variable will be used to designate an array containing "float" values, but no array has
been created by this declaration yet. For the moment, the array variable contains no valid array ID, its value being
`na`:

```
float[] prices = na
```

We could also write the above example in this alternate form:

```
array<float> prices = na
```

When declaring an array and the `<expression>` is not `na`, one of the following functions must be used:
`array.new_<type>(size, initial_value)`, `array.from()`, or `array.copy()`. For the
`array.new_<type>(size, initial_value)` functions, the arguments of the `size` and `initial_value`
parameters can be “series” to allow dynamic sizing and initialization of array elements. The following example
creates an array containing zero “float” elements, and this time, the array ID returned by the `array.new_float()`
function call is assigned to `prices`:

```
prices = array.new_float(0)
```

Similar array creation functions exist for the other types of array elements: `array.new_int()`, `array.new_bool()`, `array.new_color()`, `array.new_string()`, `array.new_line()`, `array.new_linefill()`, `array.new_label()`, `array.new_box()` and `array.new_table()`.

When declaring an array using one of the array creation functions, you can initialize all elements using the `initial_value` parameter. When no argument is supplied for `initial_value`, the array elements are initialized to `na`. The following declaration creates an array ID named `prices`. The array is created with two elements, each initialized with the value of the `close` built-in variable on that bar:

```
prices = array.new_float(2, close)
```

You can also use `array.from()` to create an array and initialize it with different values at the same time. `array.from()` infers the array's size and the type of its elements, which must be consistent, from the arguments supplied to the function when calling it. Similarly to ``array.new_*()` functions, it accepts “series” arguments.

All three of the lines of code below will create identical "bool” arrays with the same two elements:

```
statesArray = array.from(close > open, high != close)
bool[] statesArray = array.from(close > open, high != close)
array<bool> statesArray = array.from(close > open, high != close)
```

## Using the `var` keyword

The `var` keyword can be used when declaring arrays. It works just as it does for other variables; it causes the declaration to only be executed on the first iteration of the script on the dataset's bar at `bar_index` zero. Because the array is never re-initialized on subsequent bars, its value will persist across bars, as the script iterates on them.

When an array declaration is done using `var` and a new value is pushed at the end of the array on each bar, the array will grow by one on each bar and be of size `bar_index` + 1 plus one (`bar_index` starts at zero) by the time the script executes on the last bar, as this code will do:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Using `var`")
var a = array.new_float(0)
array.push(a, close)
if barstate.islast
    label.new(bar_index, 0, "Array size: " + str.tostring(array.size(a)) + "\nbar_index")
```

The same code without the `var` keyword would re-declare the array on each bar. After execution of the `array.push()` call, the array would thus be of size one on all the dataset's bars.

This initializes an array of constant lengths which will not change during the script's execution, so we only declare it on the first bar:

```
var int[] lengths = array.from(2, 12, 20, 50, 100, 200)
```

## Reading and writing array values

Values can be written to existing individual array elements using `array.set(id, index, value)`, and read using `array.get(id, index)`. As is the case whenever an array index is used in your code, it is imperative that the index never be greater than the array's size, minus one (because array indices start at zero). You can obtain the size of an array by using the `array.size(id)` function.

The following example uses `array.set()` to initialize an array of colors to instances of one base color using different
transparency levels. It then fetches the proper array element to use it in a `bgcolor()` call:



```
//@version=5
indicator("Distance from high", "", true)
lookbackInput = input.int(100)
FILL_COLOR = color.green
// Declare array and set its values on the first bar only.
var fillColors = array.new_color(5)
if barstate.isfirst
    // Initialize the array elements with progressively lighter shades of the fill colo
    array.set(fillColors, 0, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 70))
    array.set(fillColors, 1, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 75))
    array.set(fillColors, 2, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 80))
    array.set(fillColors, 3, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 85))
    array.set(fillColors, 4, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 90))

// Find the offset to highest high. Change its sign because the function returns a nega
lastHiBar = ta.highestbars(high, lookbackInput)
// Convert the offset to an array index, capping it to 4 to avoid a runtime error.
// The index used by `array.get()` will be the equivalent of `floor(fillNo)`.
fillNo = math.min(lastHiBar / (lookbackInput / 5), 4)
// Set background to a progressively lighter fill with increasing distance from locatio
bgcolor(array.get(fillColors, fillNo))
// Plot key values to the Data Window for debugging.
plotchar(lastHiBar, "lastHiBar", "", location.top, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(fillNo, "fillNo", "", location.top, size = size.tiny)
```

Another technique that can be used to initialize the elements in an array is to declare the array with size zero, and
then populate it using `array.push()` to append new elements to the end of the array, increasing the size of the array
by one at each call. The following code is functionally identical to the initialization section from the preceding script:

```
// Declare array and set its values on the first bar only.
var fillColors = array.new_color(0)
if barstate.isfirst
    // Initialize the array elements with progressively lighter shades of the fill colo
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 70))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 75))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 80))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 85))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 90))
```

Finally, we could use `array.from()`:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Using `var`")
FILL_COLOR = color.green
var color[] fillColors =
    array.from(
         color.new(FILL_COLOR, 70),
         color.new(FILL_COLOR, 75),
         color.new(FILL_COLOR, 80),
         color.new(FILL_COLOR, 85),
         color.new(FILL_COLOR, 90))
// Cycle background through the array's colors.
bgcolor(array.get(fillColors, bar_index % array.size(fillColors)))
```

The `array.fill(id, value, index_from, index_to)` function can be used to fill contiguous sets of array elements with a value. Used without the last two optional parameters, the function fills the whole array, so:

```
a = array.new_float(10, close)
```

and:

```
a = array.new_float(10)
array.fill(a, close)
```

are equivalent, but:

```
a = array.new_float(10)
array.fill(a, close, 1, 3)
```

only fills the second and third elements (at index 1 and 2) of the array with `close`. Note how `array.fill()`'s last parameter, `index_to`, needs to be one greater than the last index to be filled. The remaining elements will hold the `na` value, as no intialization value was provided when the array was declared.

## Looping through array elements

When looping through array elements when the array's size is unknown, you can use:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Protected `for` loop", overlay = true)
array<float> a = request.security_lower_tf(syminfo.tickerid, "1", close)
string labelText = ""
for i = 0 to (array.size(a) == 0 ? na: array.size(a) - 1)
    labelText += str.tostring(array.get(a, i)) + "\n"
label.new(bar_index, high, text = labelText)
```

Note that:

*   We use the `request.security_lower_tf()` function which returns an array of `close` prices at the `1` minute timeframe.
*   This code example will throw an error if you use it on a chart timeframe smaller than `1` minute.
*   `for` loops do not execute if the `to` expression is `na`. Note that the `to` value is only evaluated once upon
entry.
A much more recommended method to loop through array elements when the array's size is unknown is to use a for...in loop. This method is a variation of the traditional for loop that dynamically adjusts the number of iterations based on the array's size. Here is an example of how you can write the code example from above using this method:

```
//@version=5
indicator("`for...in` loop", overlay = true)
array<float> a = request.security_lower_tf(syminfo.tickerid, "1", close)

string labelText = ""
for price in a
    labelText += str.tostring(price) + "\n"

label.new(bar_index, high, text = labelText)
```

A `while` loop statement can also be used:

```
//@version=5
indicator("`while` loop", overlay = true)
array<float> a = request.security_lower_tf(syminfo.tickerid, "1", close)

string labelText = ""
int i = 0
while i < array.size(a)
    labelText += str.tostring(array.get(a, i)) + "\n"
    i += 1

label.new(bar_index, high, text = labelText)
```

## Scope

Arrays can be declared in a script's global scope, as well as in the local scope of a function or an `if` branch. One major distinction between Pine Script™ arrays and variables declared in the global scope, is that global arrays can be modified from within the local scope of a function. This new capability can be used to implement global variables that can be both read and set from within any function in the script. We use it here to calculate progressively lower or higher levels:

//@version=5
indicator("Bands", "", true)
factorInput = 1 + (input.float(-2., "Step %") / 100)
// Use the lowest average OHLC in last 50 bars from 10 bars back as the our base level.
level = array.new_float(1, ta.lowest(ohlc4, 50) [10])
nextLevel (val)
=>
newLevel = array.get(level, 0) * val
// Write new level to the global array so it can be used as the base in the next ca
array.set(level, 0, newLevel)
newLevel
plot(nextLevel(1))
plot(nextLevel(factorInput))
plot(nextLevel(factorInput))
plot(nextLevel(factorInput))

## History referencing

Past instances of array IDs or elements cannot be referenced directly using Pine Script™'s `[]` history-referencing
operator. One cannot write: `array.get(a[1], 0)` to fetch the value of the array's first element on the previous
bar.

In Pine Script ™, however, each call to a function leaves behind a series trail of function results on previous bars. This
series can in turn be used when working with arrays. One can thus write: `ma = ta.sma(array.get(a, 0), 20)`
to calculate the simple moving average of the value returned by the `array.get(a, 0)` call on the last 20 bars.

To illustrate this, let's first see how we can fetch the previous bar's `close` value in two, equivalent ways. For
`previousClose1` we use the result of the `array.get(a, 0)` function call on the previous bar. Since on the
previous bar the array's only element was initialized to that bar's `close` (as it is on every bar), referring to
`array.get(a, 0) [1]` returns that bar's `close`, i.e., the value of the `array.get(a, 0)` call on the previous
bar.

For `previousClose2` we use the history-referencing operator to fetch the previous bar's `close` in normal Pine
Script™ fashion:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("History referencing")
// Re-declare the array on each bar.
a = array.new_float(1)
// Set the value of its only element to `close`.
array.set(a, 0, close)

previousClose1 = array.get(a, 0) [1]
previousClose2 = close [1]
plot(previousClosel, "previousClosel", color.gray, 6)
plot(previousClose2, "previousClose2", color.white, 2)
```

In the following example we add two, equivalent calculations of a moving average to our previous code example. For
`ma1` we use `ta.sma()` on the series of values returned by the `array.get(a, 0)` function call on each bar. Since at
this point in the script the call returns the current bar's `close`, that is the value used for the average's calculation.
We evaluate `ma2` using the usual way we would calculate a simple average in Pine Script ™:

History referencing
```
//@version=5
indicator("History referencing")
a = array.new_float(1)
array.set(a, 0, close)
previousClose1 = array.get(a, 0) [1]
previousClose2 = close [1]
plot(previousClosel, "previousClosel", color.gray, 6)
plot(previousClose2, "previousClose2", color.white, 2)

mal = ta.sma(array.get(a, 0), 20)
ma2 = ta.sma (close, 20)
plot(mal, "MA 1", color.aqua, 6)
plot(ma2, "MA 2", color.white, 2)

// Last set having no impact.
array.set(a, 0, 10.0)
```

Notice the last line of this script. It illustrates how even if we set the value of the array's element to 10.0 at the
end of the script, resulting in the final value for the element being committed as 10.0 on the bar's last execution of
the script, the earlier call to `array.get(a, 0)` nonetheless returned the `close` value because that was the value
of the array element at that point in the script. The series value of the function call will thus be each bar's `close`
value.

## Inserting and removing array elements

### Inserting

Three functions can be used to insert new elements in an array.

`array.unshift()` inserts a new element at the beginning of an array, at index zero, and shifts any existing elements
right by one.

`array.insert()` can insert a new element at any position in the array. Its `index` parameter is the index where the new
element will be added. The element existing at the index used in the function call and any others to its right are
shifted one place to the right:

```markdown
//@version=5
indicator("`array.insert()`")
a = array.new_float(5, 0)
for i = 0 to 4
    array.set(a, i, i + 1)
if barstate.islast
    label.new(bar_index, 0, "BEFORE\na: " + str.tostring(a), size = size.large)
    array.insert(a, 2, 999)
    label.new(bar_index, 0, "AFTER\na: " + str.tostring(a), style = label.style_label_right)

`array.push()` will add a new element at the end of an array.

## Removing

Four functions can be used to remove elements from an array. The first three will return the value of the removed element.

`array.remove()` removes the element at the `index` value used, and returns that element's value.

`array.shift()` removes the first element from an array and returns its value.

`array.pop()` removes the last element of an array and returns its value.

`array.clear()` will remove all elements from an array. Note that clearing an array won't delete the underlying data.

See the example below which illustrates how this works:

//@version=5
indicator("`array.clear()`example", overlay = true)
// We create a label array and add a label to the array on each new bar
var a = array.new_label()
label lbl = label.new(bar_index, high, "Text", color = color.red)
array.push(a, lbl)

var table t = table.new(position.top_right, 1, 1)
// We clear the array on the last bar which won't delete the individual labels
if barstate.islast
    array.clear(a)
    table.cell(t, 0, 0, "Array elements count: " + str.tostring(array.size(a)), bgcolor=color.aqua)

## Using an array as a stack

Stacks are LIFO (last in, first out) constructions. They behave somewhat like a vertical pile of books to which books can only be added or removed one at a time, always from the top. Pine Script™ arrays can be used as a stack, in which case you will use the `array.push()` and `array.pop()` functions to add and remove elements at the end of the array.

`array.push(prices, close)` will add a new element to the end of the `prices` array, increasing the array's size by one.

`array.pop(prices)` will remove the end element from the `prices` array, return its value and decrease the array's size by one.

See how the functions are used here to remember successive lows in rallies:

    // Rising highs; push a new low on the stack.
    array.push(lows, low)
    // Force the return type of this `if` block to be the same as that of the next bloc
    bool (na)
else if array.size (lows) >= 4 or low < array.min(lows)
    // We have at least 4 lows or price has breached the lowest low;
    // sort lows and set flag indicating we will plot and flush the levels.
    array.sort(lows, order.ascending)
    flushLows := true

plot(lowLevel, "Low 4", low > lowLevel ? color.silver : color.purple, 5, plot.style_linebr)

if flushLows
    // Clear remaining levels after the last 4 have been plotted.
    array.clear(lows)
```

## Using an array as a queue
Queues are FIFO (first in, first out) constructions. They behave somewhat like cars arriving at a red light. New cars are
queued at the end of the line, and the first car to leave will be the first one that arrived to the red light.

In the following code example, we let users decide through the script's inputs how many labels they want to have on
their chart. We use that quantity to determine the size of the array of labels we then create, initializing the array's
elements to `na`.

When a new pivot is detected, we create a label for it, saving the label's ID in the `pLabel` variable. We then queue
the ID of that label by using `array.push()` to append the new label's ID to the end of the array, making our array size one greater than the maximum number of labels to keep on the chart.

Lastly, we de-queue the oldest label by removing the array's first element using `array.shift()` and deleting the label referenced by that array element's value. As we have now de-queued an element from our queue, the array contains `pivotCountInput` elements once again. Note that on the dataset's first bars we will be deleting `na` label IDs until the maximum number of labels has been created, but this does not cause runtime errors. Let's look at our code:

![Chart Image]

```pine
//@version=5
MAX_LABELS = 100
indicator("Show Last n High Pivots", "", true, max_labels_count = MAX_LABELS)

pivotCountInput = input.int(5, "How many pivots to show", minval = 0, maxval = MAX_LABELS)
pivotLegsInput = input.int(3, "Pivot legs", minval = 1, maxval = 5)

// Create an array containing the user-selected max count of label IDs.
var labelIds = array.new_label(pivotCountInput)

pHi = ta.pivothigh(pivotLegsInput, pivotLegsInput)
if not na(pHi)
    // New pivot found; plot its label `i_pivotLegs` bars back.
    pLabel = label.new(bar_index[pivotLegsInput], pHi, str.tostring(pHi, format.mintick))
    // Queue the new label's ID by appending it to the end of the array.
    array.push(labelIds, pLabel)
    // De-queue the oldest label ID from the queue and delete the corresponding label.
    label.delete(array.shift(labelIds))
```

## Calculations on arrays

While series variables can be viewed as a horizontal set of values stretching back in time, Pine Script™'s one-dimensional arrays can be viewed as vertical structures residing on each bar. As an array's set of elements is not a time series, Pine Script™'s usual mathematical functions are not allowed on them. Special-purpose functions must be used to operate on all of an array's values. The available functions are: `array.abs()`, `array.avg()`, `array.covariance()`, `array.min()`, `array.max()`, `array.median()`, `array.mode()`, `array.percentile_linear_interpolation()`, `array.percentile_nearest_rank()`, `array.percentrank()`, `array.range()`, `array.standardize()`, `array.stdev()`, `array.sum()`, `array.variance()`.

Note that contrary to the usual mathematical functions in Pine Script™, those used on arrays do not return `na` when some of the values they calculate on have `na` values. There are a few exceptions to this rule:

*   When all array elements have `na` value or the array contains no elements, `na` is returned.

• `array.standardize()` however, will return an empty array.
• `array.mode()` will return `na` when no mode is found.

## Manipulating arrays

### Concatenation

Two arrays can be merged—or concatenated—using `array.concat()`. When arrays are concatenated, the second array is appended to the end of the first, so the first array is modified while the second one remains intact. The function returns the array ID of the first array:

`array.concat()`

```
//@version=5
indicator("`array.concat()`")
a = array.new_float(0)
b = array.new_float(0)
array.push(a, 0)
array.push(a, 1)
array.push(b, 2)
array.push(b, 3)
if barstate.islast
    label.new(bar_index, 0, "BEFORE\na: " + str.tostring(a) + "\nb: " + str.tostring(b))
    c = array.concat(a, b)
    array.push(c, 4)
    label.new(bar_index, 0, "AFTER\na: " + str.tostring(a) + "\nb: " + str.tostring(b))
```

### Copying

You can copy an array using `array.copy()`. Here we copy the array `a` to a new array named `_b`:

`array.copy()`

//@version=5
indicator("`array.copy()`")
```
a = array.new_float(0)
array.push(a, 0)
array.push(a, 1)
if barstate.islast
    b = array.copy(a)
    array.push(b, 2)
    label.new(bar_index, 0, "a: " + str.tostring(a) + "\nb: " + str.tostring(b), size = size.tiny)
```

Note that simply using `b = a` in the previous example would not have copied the array, but only its ID. From thereon, both variables would point to the same array, so using either one would affect the same array.

## Joining

Use `array.join()` to concatenate all of the elements in the array into a string and separate these elements with the specified separator:

```
//@version=5
indicator("")
v1 = array.new_string(10, "test")
v2 = array.new_string(10, "test")
array.push(v2, "test1")
v3 = array.new_float(5, 5)
v4 = array.new_int(5, 5)
l1 = label.new(bar_index, close, array.join(v1))
l2 = label.new(bar_index, close, array.join(v2, ","))
l3 = label.new(bar_index, close, array.join(v3, ","))
l4 = label.new(bar_index, close, array.join(v4, ","))
```

## Sorting

Arrays containing "int" or "float" elements can be sorted in either ascending or descending order using `array.sort()`. The `order` parameter is optional and defaults to `order.ascending`. As all `array.*()` function arguments, it is of form "series", so can be determined at runtime, as is done here. Note that in the example, which array is sorted is also determined at runtime:

TESLA INC 1D Cboe BZX
01860.68 H2021.99 L1857.06 C2001.83 +123.30 (+6.56%)

`array.sort()`

a is sorted ▲: [0, 1, 2]
b is not sorted: [4, 3, 5]

```
//@version=5
indicator("`array.sort()`")
a = array.new_float(0)
b = array.new_float(0)
array.push(a, 2)
array.push(a, 0)
array.push(a, 1)
array.push(b, 4)
array.push(b, 3)
array.push(b, 5)
if barstate.islast
    barUp = close > open
    array.sort(barUp ? a: b, barUp ? order.ascending : order.descending)
    label.new(bar_index, 0,
      "a " + (barUp ? "is sorted ▲: " : "is not sorted: ") + str.tostring(a) + "\n\n" +
      "b " + (barUp ? "is not sorted: " : "is sorted ▼: ") + str.tostring(b), size = size.auto)

Another useful option for sorting arrays is to use the `array.sort_indices()` function, which takes a reference to the original array and returns an array containing the indices from the original array. Please note that this function won't modify the original array. The `order` parameter is optional and defaults to `order.ascending`.

## Reversing

Use `array.reverse()` to reverse an array:

```
//@version=5
indicator("`array.reverse()`")
a = array.new_float(0)
array.push(a, 0

# Objects

*   
*   
*   Changing field values
*   Collecting objects
*   Copying objects
*   Shadowing

**Note**

This page contains advanced material. If you are a beginning Pine Script™ programmer, we recommend that you
become familiar with other, more accessible Pine Script™ features before you venture here.

# Introduction

Pine Script™ objects are instances of *user-defined types* (UDTs). They are the equivalent of variables containing parts
called *fields*, each able to hold independent values that can be of various types.

Experienced programmers can think of UDTs as methodless classes. They allow users to create custom types that
organize different values under one logical entity.

# Creating objects

Before an object can be created, its type must be defined. The  section of the  page
explains how to do so.

Let's define a `pivotPoint` type to hold pivot information:

```
type pivotPoint
    int x
    float y
    string xloc = xloc.bar_time
```

Note that:

*   We use the `type` keyword to declare the creation of a UDT.
*   We name our new UDT `pivotPoint`.
*   After the first line, we create a local block containing the type and name of each field.
*   The `x` field will hold the x-coordinate of the pivot. It is declared as an "int" because it will hold either a timestamp or a bar index of "int" type.
*   `y` is a "float" because it will hold the pivot's price.
*   `xloc` is a field that will specify the units of `x`: `xloc.bar_index` or `xloc.bar_time`. We set its default value to `xloc.bar_time` by using the `=` operator. When an object is created from that UDT, its `xloc` field will thus be set to that value.

Now that our `pivotPoint` UDT is defined, we can proceed to create objects from it. We create objects using the UDT's `new()` built-in method. To create a new `foundPoint` object from our `pivotPoint` UDT, we use:

```
foundPoint = pivotPoint.new()
```

We can also specify field values for the created object using the following:

```
foundPoint = pivotPoint.new(time, high)
```

Or the equivalent:

```
foundPoint = pivotPoint.new(x = time, y = high)
```

At this point, the `foundPoint` object's `x` field will contain the value of the `time` built-in when it is created, `y` will contain the value of `high` and the `xloc` field will contain its default value of `xloc.bar_time` because no value was defined for it when creating the object.

Object placeholders can also be created by declaring `na` object names using the following:

```
pivotPoint foundPoint = na
```

This example displays a label where high pivots are detected. The pivots are detected `legsInput` bars after they occur, so we must plot the label in the past for it to appear on the pivot:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Pivot labels", overlay = true)
int legsInput = input(10)

// Define the `pivotPoint` UDT.
type pivotPoint
    int x
    float y
    string xloc = xloc.bar_time

// Detect high pivots.
pivotHighPrice = ta.pivothigh(legsInput, legsInput)
if not na (pivotHighPrice)
    // A new high pivot was found; display a label where it occurred `legsInput` bars b
    foundPoint = pivotPoint.new(time [legsInput], pivotHighPrice)
    label.new(
         foundPoint.x,
         foundPoint.y,
         str.tostring(foundPoint.y, format.mintick),
         foundPoint.xloc,
         textcolor = color.white)
```

Take note of this line from the above example:

```
foundPoint = pivotPoint.new(time [legsInput), pivotHighPrice)
```

This could also be written using the following:

```
pivot Point foundPoint = na
foundPoint := pivotPoint.new(time [legsInput), pivotHighPrice)
```

When an object is created using `var` or `varip`, those keywords apply to all of the object's fields:

```
//@version=5
indicator("")
type barInfo
    int i = bar_index
    int t = time
    float c = close

// Created on bar zero.
var firstBar = barInfo.new()
// Created on every bar.
currentBar = barInfo.new()

plot(firstBar.i)
plot(currentBar.i)
```

## Changing field values

The value of an object's fields can be changed using the `:=` reassignment operator.
This line of our previous example:

```
foundPoint = pivotPoint.new(time [legsInput), pivotHighPrice)
```

Could be written using the following:

```
foundPoint = pivotPoint.new()
foundPoint.x := time [legsInput]
foundPoint.y := pivotHighPrice
```

## Collecting objects

Arrays and matrices can contain objects, allowing users to add virtual dimensions to their data structures. To declare
object arrays and matrices, use UDT names in , which are constructed using angle brackets.

This example declares an empty array that will hold objects of the `pivotPoint` UDT and initializes the
`pivotHighArray` variable with its ID:

```
pivotHighArray = array.new<pivotPoint>()
```

To explicitly declare the type of a variable as an `array` or a `matrix` of a user-defined type, you can use the `array<>` and
`matrix<>` keywords, e.g.:

```
var array<pivotPoint> pivotHighArray = na
pivotHighArray := array.new<pivotPoint>()

Let's use what we have learned to create a script that detects high pivot points. The script first collects historical
pivot information in an array. It then loops through the array on the last historical bar, creating a label for each pivot
and connecting the pivots with lines:

        // Save the pivot for use in the next iteration.
        previousPoint := eachPivot

Copying objects
Pine Script ™ objects are assigned by reference. When an existing object is assigned to a new variable, both point to
the same object.

In the example below, we create a `pivot1` object and set its `x` field to 1000. Then, we declare a `pivot2` variable
containing the reference to the `pivot1` object, so both point to the same instance. Changing `pivot2.x` will thus
also change `pivot1.x`, as both refer to the `x` field of the same object:

//@version=5
indicator("")
type pivotPoint
    int x
    float y
pivot1 = pivotPoint.new()
pivot1.x := 1000
pivot2 = pivot1
pivot2.x := 2000
// Both plot the value 2000.
plot(pivot1.x)
plot(pivot2.x)

To create a copy of an object that is independent of the original, we can use the built-in `copy()` method in this
case.

In this example, we declare the `pivot2` variable referring to a copied instance of the `pivot1` object. Now, changing `pivot2.x` will not change `pivot1.x`, as it refers to the `x` field of a separate object:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("")
type pivotPoint
    int x
    int y
pivot1 = pivotPoint.new()
pivot1.x := 1000
pivot2 = pivotPoint.copy(pivot1)
pivot2.x := 2000
// Plots 1000 and 2000.
plot(pivot1.x)
plot(pivot2.x)
```

It's important to note that the built-in `copy()` method produces a *shallow copy* of an object. If an object has fields with special types (`array`, `matrix`, `line`, `linefill`, `label`, `box`, or `table`), those fields in a shallow copy of the object will point to the same instances as the original.

In the following example, we have defined an `InfoLabel` type with a `label` as one of its fields. The script instantiates a shallow copy of the `parent` object, then calls a user-defined `set()` method to update the `info` and `lbl` fields of each object. Since the `lbl` field of both objects points to the same `label` instance, changes to this field in either object affect the other:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Shallow Copy")
type InfoLabel
    string info
    label lbl

method set (InfoLabel this, int x = na, int y = na, string info = na) =>
    if not na(x)
        this.lbl.set_x(x)
    if not na(y)
        this.lbl.set_y(y)
    if not na (info)
        this.info := info
        this.lbl.set_text(this.info)

var parent = InfoLabel.new("", label.new(0, 0))
var shallow = parent.copy()

parent.set(bar_index, 0, "Parent")
shallow.set(bar_index, 1, "Shallow Copy")
```

To produce a deep copy of an object with all of its special type fields pointing to independent instances, we must explicitly copy those fields as well.

In this example, we have defined a `deepCopy()` method that instantiates a new `InfoLabel` object with its `lbl` field pointing to a copy of the original's field. Changes to the deep copy's `lbl` field will not affect the `parent` object, as it points to a separate instance:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Deep Copy")

type InfoLabel
    string info
    label lbl

method set (InfoLabel this, int x = na, int y = na, string info = na) =>
    if not na(x)
        this.lbl.set_x(x)
    if not na(y)
        this.lbl.set_y(y)
    if not na(info)
        this.info := info
        this.lbl.set_text(this.info)

method deepCopy (InfoLabel this) =>
    InfoLabel.new(this.info, this.lbl.copy())

var parent = InfoLabel.new("", label.new(0, 0))
var deep = parent.deepCopy()

parent.set(bar_index, 0, "Parent")
deep.set(bar_index, 1, "Deep Copy")

## Shadowing

To avoid potential conflicts in the eventuality where namespaces added to Pine Script™ in the future would collide with UDTs or object names in existing scripts; as a rule, UDTs and object names shadow the language's namespaces.
For example, a UDT or object can use the name of built-in types, such as `line` or `table`.

Only the language's five primitive types cannot be used to name UDTs or objects: `int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`, and `color`.

**Note**

This page contains advanced material. If you are a beginning Pine Script ™ programmer, we recommend that you become familiar with other, more accessible Pine Script ™ features before you venture here.

## Introduction

Pine Script™ methods are specialized functions associated with specific instances of built-in or user-defined types. They are essentially the same as regular functions in most regards but offer a shorter, more convenient syntax. Users can access methods using dot notation on variables directly, just like accessing the fields of a Pine Script ™ object.

## Built-in methods

Pine Script™ includes built-in methods for `array`, `matrix`, `line`, `linefill`, `label`, `box`, and `table` types. These methods provide users with a more concise way to call specialized routines for these types within their scripts.

When using these special types, the expressions

`<namespace>.<functionName>([paramName =) <objectName>, ...)`

and

`<objectName>.<functionName>(...)`

are equivalent. For example, rather than using

`array.get(id, index)`

to get the value from an array `id` at the specified `index`, we can simply use

`id.get(index)`

to achieve the same effect. This notation eliminates the need for users to reference the function's namespace, as
`get()` is a method of `id` in this context.

Written below is a practical example to demonstrate the usage of built-in methods in place of functions.

The following script computes Bollinger Bands over a specified number of prices sampled once every n bars. It calls
`array.push()` and `array.shift()` to queue `sourceInput` values through the `sourceArray`, then `array.avg()` and
`array.stdev()` to compute the `sampleMean` and `sampleDev`. The script then uses these values to calculate the
`highBand` and `lowBand`, which it plots on the chart along with the `sampleMean`:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Custom Sample BB", overlay = true)
```

```
float sourceInput = input.source(close, "Source")
int samplesInput = input.int(20, "Samples")
int n = input.int(10, "Bars")
float multiplier = input.float(2.0, "StdDev")
var array<float> sourceArray = array.new<float>(samplesInput)
var float sampleMean = na
var float sampleDev = na
```

```
// Identify if `n` bars have passed.
if bar index % n == 0
    // Update the queue.
    array.push(sourceArray, sourceInput)
    array.shift(sourceArray)
    // Update the mean and standard deviaiton values.
    sampleMean := array.avg(sourceArray)
    sampleDev := array.stdev(sourceArray) * multiplier
```

```
// Calculate bands.
float highBand = sampleMean + sampleDev
float lowBand = sampleMean - sampleDev
```

```
plot(sampleMean, "Basis", color.orange)
plot(highBand, "Upper", color.lime)
plot(lowBand, "Lower", color.red)
```

Let's rewrite this code to utilize methods rather than built-in functions. In this version, we have replaced all built-in
`array.*` functions in the script with equivalent methods:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Custom Sample BB", overlay = true)
```

```
float sourceInput = input.source(close, "Source")
int samplesInput = input.int(20, "Samples")
int n = input.int(10, "Bars")
float multiplier = input.float(2.0, "StdDev")
var array<float> sourceArray = array.new<float>(samplesInput)
var float sampleMean = na
var float sampleDev = na
```

```
// Identify if `n` bars have passed.
if bar_index % n == 0
    // Update the queue.
    sourceArray.push(sourceInput)
    sourceArray.shift()
    // Update the mean and standard deviaiton values.
    sampleMean := sourceArray.avg()
    sampleDev := sourceArray.stdev() * multiplier
```

```
// Calculate band values.
float highBand = sampleMean + sampleDev
float lowBand = sampleMean - sampleDev
```

```
plot(sampleMean, "Basis", color.orange)
plot(highBand, "Upper", color.lime)
plot(lowBand, "Lower", color.red)
```

Note that:

• We call the array methods using `sourceArray.*` rather than referencing the `array` namespace.
• We do not include `sourceArray` as a parameter when we call the methods since they already reference the object.

## User-defined methods

Pine Script™ allows users to define custom methods for use with objects of any built-in or user-defined type. Defining a method is essentially the same as defining a function, but with two key differences:

• The `method` keyword must be included before the function name.
• The type of the first parameter in the signature must be explicitly declared, as it represents the type of object that the method will be associated with.

```
[export] method <functionName>(<paramType> <paramName> [= <defaultValue>], ...) =>
    <functionBlock>
```

Let's apply user-defined methods to our previous Bollinger Bands example to encapsulate operations from the global scope, which will simplify the code and promote reusability. See this portion from the example:

```
// Identify if `n` bars have passed.
if bar_index % n == 0
    // Update the queue.
    sourceArray.push(sourceInput)
    sourceArray.shift()
    // Update the mean and standard deviaiton values.
    sampleMean := sourceArray.avg()
    sampleDev := sourceArray.stdev() * multiplier
    // Calculate band values.
    float highBand = sampleMean + sampleDev
    float lowBand = sampleMean - sampleDev
```

We will start by defining a simple method to queue values through an array in a single call.

This `maintainQueue()` method invokes the `push()` and `shift()` methods on a `srcArray` when `takeSample` is `true` and returns the object:

```
// @function       Maintains a queue of the size of `srcArray`.
//                 It appends a `value` to the array and removes its oldest element as ...
// @param srcArray (array<float>) The array where the queue is maintained.
// @param value    (float) The new value to be added to the queue.
//                 The queue's oldest value is also removed, so its size is constant.
// @param takeSample (bool) A new `value` is only pushed into the queue if this is true
// @returns       (array<float>) `srcArray` object.
method maintainQueue (array<float> srcArray, float value, bool takeSample = true) =>
    if takeSample
        srcArray.push(value)
        srcArray.shift()
    srcArray
```

Note that:

• Just as with user-defined functions, we use the `@function` compiler annotation to document method descriptions.

Now we can replace `sourceArray.push()` and `sourceArray.shift()` with `sourceArray.maintainQueue()` in our example:

```
// Identify if `n` bars have passed.
if bar index % n == 0
  // Update the queue.
  sourceArray.maintainQueue(sourceInput)
  // Update the mean and standard deviaiton values.
  sampleMean := sourceArray.avg()
  sampleDev := sourceArray.stdev () * multiplier
  // Calculate band values.
  float highBand = sampleMean + sampleDev
  float lowBand = sampleMean - sampleDev
```

From here, we will further simplify our code by defining a method that handles all Bollinger Band calculations within
its scope.

This `calcBB()` method invokes the `avg()` and `stdev()` methods on a `srcArray` to update `mean` and `dev` values
when `calculate` is true. The method uses these values to return a tuple containing the basis, upper band, and
lower band values respectively:

```
// @function Computes Bollinger Band values from an array of data.
// @param srcArray  (array<float>) The array where the queue is maintained.
// @param multiplier (float) Standard deviaiton multiplier.
// @param calcuate  (bool) The method will only calculate new values when this is true
// @returns   A tuple containing the basis, upper band, and lower band respectiv
method calcBB (array<float> srcArray, float mult, bool calculate = true) =>
  var float mean = na
  var float dev = na
  if calculate
    // Compute the mean and standard deviation of the array.
    mean := srcArray.avg()
    dev := srcArray.stdev() * mult
  [mean, mean + dev, mean - dev]
```

With this method, we can now remove Bollinger Band calculations from the global scope and improve code readability:

```
// Identify if `n` bars have passed.
bool newSample = bar_index % n == 0
// Update the queue and compute new BB values on each new sample.
[sampleMean, highBand, lowBand] = sourceArray.maintainQueue (sourceInput, newSample).calcBB()
```

Note that:

*   Rather than using an `if` block in the global scope, we have defined a `newSample` variable that is only
    true once every n bars. The `maintainQueue()` and `calcBB()` methods use this value for their
    respective `takeSample` and `calculate` parameters.
*   Since the `maintainQueue()` method returns the object that it references, we're able to call `calcBB()`
    from the same line of code, as both methods apply to `array<float>` instances.

Here is how the full script example looks now that we've applied our user-defined methods:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Custom Sample BB", overlay = true)
```

```pine
float sourceInput   = input.source(close, "Source")
int   samplesInput = input.int(20, "Samples")
int   n            = input.int(10, "Bars")
float multiplier = input.float(2.0, "StdDev")
```

```pine
var array<float> sourceArray = array.new<float>(samplesInput)

// @function      Maintains a queue of the size of `srcArray`.
//                It appends a `value` to the array and removes its oldest element a
// @param srcArray (array<float>) The array where the queue is maintained.
// @param value    (float) The new value to be added to the queue.
//                The queue's oldest value is also removed, so its size is constant.
// @param takeSample (bool) A new `value` is only pushed into the queue if this is true
// @returns       (array<float>) `srcArray` object.
method maintainQueue (array<float> srcArray, float value, bool takeSample = true) =>
    if takeSample
        srcArray.push(value)
        srcArray.shift()
    srcArray
```

```pine
// @function Computes Bollinger Band values from an array of data.
// @param srcArray    (array<float>) The array where the queue is maintained.
// @param multiplier  (float) Standard deviaiton multiplier.
// @param calculate   (bool) The method will only calculate new values when this is true
// @returns       A tuple containing the basis, upper band, and lower band respectiv
method calcBB (array<float> srcArray, float mult, bool calculate = true) =>
    var float mean = na
    var float dev  = na
    if calculate
        // Compute the mean and standard deviation of the array.
        mean := srcArray.avg()
        dev  := srcArray.stdev() * mult
        [mean, mean + dev, mean - dev]
```

```pine
// Identify if `n` bars have passed.
bool newSample = bar_index % n == 0

// Update the queue and compute new BB values on each new sample.
[sampleMean, highBand, lowBand] = sourceArray.maintainQueue(sourceInput, newSample).calcBB(sourceArray, multiplier)

plot(sampleMean, "Basis", color.orange)
plot(highBand, "Upper", color.lime)
plot(lowBand, "Lower", color.red)
```

## Method overloading

User-defined methods can override and overload existing built-in and user-defined methods with the same identifier.
This capability allows users to define multiple routines associated with different parameter signatures under the same
method name.

As a simple example, suppose we want to define a method to identify a variable's type. Since we must explicitly
specify the type of object associated with a user-defined method, we will need to define overloads for each type that
we want it to recognize.

Below, we have defined a `getType()` method that returns a string representation of a variable's type with overloads
for the five primitive types:

```pine
// @function Identifies an object's type.
// @param this Object to inspect.
// @returns (string) A string representation of the type.
method getType(int this) =>
na (this) ? "int(na)" : "int"
method getType(float this) =>
na(this) ? "float(na)" : "float"
method getType (bool this) =>
na(this) ? "bool(na)" : "bool"
method getType (color this) =>
na(this) ? "color(na)" : "color"
method getType(string this) =>
na (this) ? "string(na)" : "string"

Now we can use these overloads to inspect some variables. This script uses str.format() to format the results from
calling the getType() method on five different variables into a single results string, then displays the string in
the 1bl label using the built-in set_text() method:

Type Inspection

1%

a: int
b: float
c: bool
d: color
e: string
```

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Type Inspection")
// @function Identifies an object's type.
// @param this Object to inspect.
// @returns (string) A string representation of the type.
method getType (int this) =>
na (this) ? "int(na)" : "int"
method getType (float this) =>
na(this) ? "float (na)" : "float"
method getType (bool this) =>
na(this) ? "bool(na)" : "bool"
method getType (color this) =>
na (this) ? "color(na)" : "color"
method getType(string this) =>
na(this) ? "string (na)" : "string"
```

```
a = 1
b = 1.0
C = true
d = color.white
e = "1"
```

```
// Inspect variables and format results.
results = str.format(
"a: {0}\nb: {1}\nc: {2}\nd: {3}\ne: {4}",
a.getType(), b.getType(), c.getType(), d.getType(), e.getType()
)

var label lbl = label.new(0,0)
lbl.set x (bar_index)
lbl.set_text(results)
```

Note that:
* The underlying type of each variable determines which overload of `getType()` the compiler will use.
* The method will append "(na)" to the output string when a variable is `na` to demarcate that it is empty.

## Advanced example

Let's apply what we've learned to construct a script that estimates the cumulative distribution of elements in an array, meaning the fraction of elements in the array that are less than or equal to any given value.

There are many ways in which we could choose to tackle this objective. For this example, we will start by defining a method to replace elements of an array, which will help us count the occurrences of elements within a range of values.

Written below is an overload of the built-in `fill()` method for `array<float>` instances. This overload replaces elements in a `srcArray` within the range between the `lowerBound` and `upperBound` with an `innerValue`, and replaces all elements outside the range with an `outerValue`:

```pine
// @function
//
// @param srcArray
// @param innerValue
// @param outerValue
Replaces elements in a `srcArray` between `lowerBound` and `upper
and replaces elements outside the range with an `outerValue`.
(array<float>) Array to modify.
(float) Value to replace elements within the range with.
(float) Value to replace elements outside the range with.
(float) Lowest value to replace with `innerValue`.
// @param lowerBound
// @param upperBound (float) Highest value to replace with `innerValue`.
// @returns
(array<float>) `srcArray` object.
method fill(array<float> srcArray, float innerValue, float outerValue, float lowerBound, float upperBound)
for [i, element] in srcArray
if (element >= lowerBound or na(lowerBound)) and (element <= upperBound or na(upperBound))
srcArray.set(i, innerValue)
else
srcArray.set(i, outerValue)
srcArray
```

With this method, we can filter an array by value ranges to produce an array of occurrences. For example, the
expression

`srcArray.copy().fill(1.0, 0.0, min, val)`

copies the `srcArray` object, replaces all elements between `min` and `val` with 1.0, then replaces all elements
above `val` with 0.0. From here, it's easy to estimate the output of the cumulative distribution function at the `val`,
as it's simply the average of the resulting array:

`srcArray.copy().fill(1.0, 0.0, min, val).avg()`

Note that:

*   The compiler will only use this `fill()` overload instead of the built-in when the user provides
    `innerValue`, `outerValue`, `lowerBound`, and `upperBound` arguments in the call.
*   If either `lowerBound` or `upperBound` is `na`, its value is ignored while filtering the fill range.
*   We are able to call `copy()`, `fill()`, and `avg()` successively on the same line of code because the first
    two methods return an `array<float>` instance.

We can now use this to define a method that will calculate our empirical distribution values. The following `eCDF()`
method estimates a number of evenly spaced ascending steps from the cumulative distribution function of a
`srcArray` and pushes the results into a `cdfArray`:

```
// @function
// @param srcArray
// @param steps
// @returns
Estimates the empirical CDF of a `srcArray`.
(array<float>) Array to calculate on.
(int) Number of steps in the estimation.
(array<float>) Array of estimated CDF ratios.
method eCDF(array<float> srcArray, int steps) =>
    float min = srcArray.min()
    float rng = srcArray.range() / steps
    array<float> cdfArray = array.new<float>()
    // Add averages of `srcArray` filtered by value region to the `cdfArray`.
    float val = min
    for i = 1 to steps
        val += rng
        cdfArray.push(srcArray.copy().fill(1.0, 0.0, min, val).avg())
    cdfArray
```

Lastly, to ensure that our `eCDF()` method functions properly for arrays containing small and large values, we will
define a method to normalize our arrays.

This `featureScale()` method uses `array.min()` and `range()` methods to produce a rescaled copy of a `srcArray`.
We will use this to normalize our arrays prior to invoking the `eCDF()` method:

```
// @function Rescales the elements within a `srcArray` to the interval [0, 1].
// @param srcArray (array<float>) Array to normalize.
// @returns (array<float>) Normalized copy of the `srcArray`.
method featureScale (array<float> srcArray) =>
    float min = srcArray.min()
    float rng = srcArray.range()
    array<float> scaledArray = array.new<float>()
    // Push normalized `element` values into the `scaledArray`.
    for element in srcArray
        scaledArray.push((element - min) / rng)
    scaledArray
```

Note that:

*   This method does not include special handling for divide by zero conditions. If `rng` is 0, the value of the array element will be `na`.

The full example below queues a `sourceArray` of size `length` with `sourceInput` values using our previous `maintainQueue()` method, normalizes the array's elements using the `featureScale()` method, then calls the `eCDF()` method to get an array of estimates for `n` evenly spaced steps on the distribution. The script then calls a user-defined `makeLabel()` function to display the estimates and prices in a label on the right side of the chart:

```
//@version=5
`indicator("Empirical Distribution", overlay = true)`

float sourceInput = input.source(close, "Source")
int length = input.int(20, "Length")
int n = input.int(20, "Steps")

// @function Maintains a queue of the size of `srcArray`.
// It appends a `value` to the array and removes its oldest element a
// @param srcArray (array<float>) The array where the queue is maintained.
// @param value (float) The new value to be added to the queue.
// The queue's oldest value is also removed, so its size is constant.
// @param takeSample (bool) A new `value` is only pushed into the queue if this is true
// @returns (array<float>) `srcArray` object.
method maintainQueue(array<float> srcArray, float value, bool takeSample = true) =>
```

```pine
if takeSample
    srcArray.push(value)
    srcArray.shift()
srcArray

// @function Replaces elements in a `srcArray` between `lowerBound` and `upper.
// and replaces elements outside the range with an `outerValue`.
// @param srcArray (array<float>) Array to modify.
// @param innerValue (float) Value to replace elements within the range with.
// @param outerValue (float) Value to replace elements outside the range with.
// @param lowerBound (float) Lowest value to replace with `innerValue`.
// @param upperBound (float) Highest value to replace with `innerValue`.
// @returns (array<float>) `srcArray` object.
method fill(array<float> srcArray, float innerValue, float outerValue, float lowerBound) =>
    for [i, element] in srcArray
        if (element >= lowerBound or na(lowerBound)) and (element <= upperBound or na(upperBound))
            srcArray.set(i, innerValue)
        else
            srcArray.set(i, outerValue)
    srcArray

// @function Estimates the empirical CDF of a `srcArray`.
// @param srcArray (array<float>) Array to calculate on.
// @param steps (int) Number of steps in the estimation.
// @returns (array<float>) Array of estimated CDF ratios.
method eCDF(array<float> srcArray, int steps) =>
    float min = srcArray.min()
    float rng = srcArray.range() / steps
    array<float> cdfArray = array.new<float>()

    // Add averages of `srcArray` filtered by value region to the `cdfArray`.
    float val = min
    for i = 1 to steps
        val += rng
        cdfArray.push(srcArray.copy().fill(1.0, 0.0, min, val).avg())
    cdfArray

// @function Rescales the elements within a `srcArray` to the interval [0, 1].
// @param srcArray (array<float>) Array to normalize.
// @returns (array<float>) Normalized copy of the `srcArray`.
method featureScale (array<float> srcArray) =>
    float min = srcArray.min()
    float rng = srcArray.range()
    array<float> scaledArray = array.new<float>()

    // Push normalized `element` values into the `scaledArray`.
    for element in srcArray
        scaledArray.push((element - min) / rng)
    scaledArray

// @function Draws a label containing eCDF estimates in the format "{price}: {percentage}".
// @param srcArray (array<float>) Array of source values.
// @param cdfArray (array<float>) Array of CDF estimates.
// @returns (void)
method makeLabel (array<float> srcArray, array<float> cdfArray) =>
    float max = srcArray.max()
    float rng = srcArray.range() / cdfArray.size
    string results = ""
    var label lbl = label.new(0, 0, "", style = label.style_label_left, text_font_family = "Monospace")

    // Add percentage strings to `results` starting from the `max`.
    cdfArray.reverse()
    for [i, element] in cdfArray
        results += str.format("{0}: {1}%\n", max - i * rng, element * 100)

    // Update `lbl` attributes.
    lbl.set_xy(bar_index + 1, srcArray.avg())
    lbl.set_text(results)

## Introduction

TradingView alerts run 24x7 on our servers and do not require users to be logged in to execute. Alerts are created from the charts user interface (UI). You will find all the information necessary to understand how alerts work and how to create them from the charts UI in the Help Center's .

Some of the alert types available on TradingView (generic alerts, drawing alerts and script alerts on order fill events) are created from symbols or scripts loaded on the chart and do not require specific coding. Any user can create these types of alerts from the charts UI.

Other types of alerts (script alerts triggering on `alert()` function calls, and `alertcondition()` alerts) require specific Pine Script™ code to be present in a script to create an alert event before script users can create alerts from them using the charts UI. Additionally, while script users can create script alerts triggering on order fill events from the charts UI on any strategy loaded on their chart, Pine Script™ programmers can specify explicit order fill alert messages in their script for each type of order filled by the broker emulator.

This page covers the different ways Pine Script™ programmers can code their scripts to create alert events from which script users will in turn be able to create alerts from the charts UI. We will cover:

*   How to use the `alert()` function to `alert()` function calls in indicators or strategies, which can then be included in script alerts created from the charts UI.
*   How to add custom alert messages to be included in script alerts triggering on the order fill events of strategies.
*   How to use the `alertcondition()` function to generate, in indicators only, `alertcondition()` events which can then be used to create `alertcondition()` alerts from the charts UI.

Keep in mind that:
*   No alert-related Pine Script™ code can create a running alert in the charts UI; it merely creates alert events which can then be used by script users to create running alerts from the charts UI.
*   Alerts only trigger in the realtime bar. The operational scope of Pine Script™ code dealing with any type of alert is therefore restricted to realtime bars only.
*   When an alert is created in the charts UI, TradingView saves a mirror image of the script and its inputs, along with the chart's main symbol and timeframe to run the alert on its servers. Subsequent changes to your script's inputs or the chart will thus not affect running alerts previously created from them. If you want any changes to your context to be reflected in a running alert's behavior, you will need to delete the alert and create a new one in the new context.

Background

The different methods Pine Script ™ programmers can use today to create alert events in their script are the result of successive enhancements deployed throughout Pine Script ™'s evolution. The `alertcondition()` function, which works in indicators only, was the first feature allowing Pine Script ™ programmers to create alert events. Then came order fill alerts for strategies, which trigger when the broker emulator creates order fill events. Order fill events require no special code for script users to create alerts on them, but by way of the `alert_message` parameter for order-generating `strategy.*()` functions, programmers can customize the message of alerts triggering on order fill events by defining a distinct alert message for any number of order fulfillment events.

The `alert()` function is the most recent addition to Pine Script™. It more or less supersedes `alertcondition()`, and when used in strategies, provides a useful complement to alerts on order fill events.

Which type of alert is best?

For Pine Script ™ programmers, the `alert()` function will generally be easier and more flexible to work with. Contrary to `alertcondition()`, it allows for dynamic alert messages, works in both indicators and strategies and the programmer decides on the frequency of `alert()` events.

While `alert()` calls can be generated on any logic programmable in Pine Script™, including when orders are sent to the broker emulator in strategies, they cannot be coded to trigger when orders are executed (or filled) because after orders are sent to the broker emulator, the emulator controls their execution and does not report fill events back to the script directly.

When a script user wants to generate an alert on a strategy's order fill events, he must include those events when creating a script alert on the strategy in the “Create Alert" dialog box. No special code is required in scripts for users to be able to do this. The message sent with order fill events can, however, be customized by programmers through use of the `alert_message` parameter in order-generating `strategy.*()` function calls. A combination of `alert()` calls and the use of custom `alert_message` arguments in order-generating `strategy.*()` calls should allow Pine Script ™ programmers to generate alert events on most conditions occurring in their script's execution.

The `alertcondition()` function remains in Pine Script™ for backward compatibility, but it can also be used advantageously to generate distinct alerts available for selection as individual items in the "Create Alert" dialog box's "Condition" field.

Script alerts

When a script user creates a script alert using the "Create Alert" dialog box, the events able to trigger the alert will vary depending on whether the alert is created from an indicator or a strategy.

A script alert created from an indicator will trigger when:
*   The indicator contains `alert()` calls.
*   The code's logic allows a specific `alert()` call to execute.
*   The frequency specified in the `alert()` call allows the alert to trigger.

A script alert created from a strategy can trigger on `alert()` function calls, on order fill events, or both. The script
user creating an alert on a strategy decides which type of events he wishes to include in his script alert. While users
can create a script alert on order fill events without the need for a strategy to include special code, it must contain
`alert()` calls for users to include `alert()` function calls in their script alert.

### `alert()` function events
The `alert()` function has the following signature:

```
alert(message, freq)
```

`message`
A "series string" representing the message text sent when the alert triggers. Because this argument allows the "series" form, it can be generated at runtime and differ bar to bar, making it dynamic.

`freq`
An "input string" specifying the triggering frequency of the alert. Valid arguments are:
*   `alert.freq_once_per_bar`: Only the first call per realtime bar triggers the alert (default value).
*   `alert.freq_once_per_bar_close`: An alert is only triggered when the realtime bar closes and an `alert()` call is executed during that script iteration.
*   `alert.freq_all`: All calls during the realtime bar trigger the alert.

The `alert()` function can be used in both indicators and strategies. For an `alert()` call to trigger a script alert configured on `alert()` function calls, the script's logic must allow the `alert()` call to execute, and the frequency determined by the `freq` parameter must allow the alert to trigger.

Note that by default, strategies are recalculated at the bar's close, so if the `alert()` function with the frequency `alert.freq_all` or `alert.freq_once_per_bar` is used in a strategy, then it will be called no more often than once at the bar's close. In order to enable the `alert()` function to be called during the bar construction process, you need to enable the `calc_on_every_tick` option.

### Using all `alert()` calls
Let's look at an example where we detect crosses of the RSI centerline:

```
//@version=5
indicator("All `alert()`calls")
r = ta.rsi(close, 20)

// Detect crosses.
xUp = ta.crossover ( r, 50)
xDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)
// Trigger an alert on crosses.
if xUp
    alert("Go long (RSI is " + str.tostring(r, "#.00)"))
else if xDn
    alert("Go short (RSI is " + str.tostring(r, "#.00)"))

plotchar(xUp, "Go Long", "A", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(xDn, "Go Short", "V", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)
hline(50)
plot(r)
```

If a script alert is created from this script:

*   When RSI crosses the centerline up, the script alert will trigger with the "Go long..." message. When RSI crosses the centerline down, the script alert will trigger with the "Go short..." message.
*   Because no argument is specified for the `freq` parameter in the `alert()` call, the default value of `alert.freq_once_per_bar` will be used, so the alert will only trigger the first time each of the `alert()` calls is executed during the realtime bar.
*   The message sent with the alert is composed of two parts: a constant string and then the result of the `str.tostring()` call which will include the value of RSI at the moment where the `alert()` call is executed by the script. An alert message for a cross up would look like: "Go long (RSI is 53.41)".
*   Because a script alert always triggers on any occurrence of a call to `alert()`, as long as the frequency used in the call allows for it, this particular script does not allow a script user to restrict his script alert to longs only, for example.

Note that:
*   Contrary to an `alertcondition()` call which is always placed at column 0 (in the script's global scope), the `alert()` call is placed in the local scope of an `if` branch so it only executes when our triggering condition is met. If an `alert()` call was placed in the script's global scope at column 0, it would execute on all bars, which would likely not be the desired behavior.
*   An `alertcondition()` could not accept the same string we use for our alert's message because of its use of the `str.tostring()` call. `alertcondition()` messages must be constant strings.

Lastly, because `alert()` messages can be constructed dynamically at runtime, we could have used the following code to generate our alert events:

```
// Trigger an alert on crosses.
if xUp or xDn
    firstPart = (xUp? "Go long" : "Go short") + " (RSI is "
    alert(firstPart + str.tostring(r, "%.00"))
```

### Using selective `alert()` calls
When users create a script alert on `alert()` function calls, the alert will trigger on any call the script makes to the `alert()` function, provided its frequency constraints are met. If you want to allow your script's users to select which `alert()` function call in your script will trigger a script alert, you will need to provide them with the means to indicate their preference in your script's inputs, and code the appropriate logic in your script. This way, script users will be able to create multiple script alerts from a single script, each behaving differently as per the choices made in the script's inputs prior to creating the alert in the charts UI.

Suppose, for our next example, that we want to provide the option of triggering alerts on only longs, only shorts, or both. You could code your script like this:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Selective `alert()` calls")
detectLongsInput = input.bool(true, "Detect Longs")
detectShortsInput = input.bool(true, "Detect Shorts")
repaintInput = input.bool(false, "Allow Repainting")

r = ta.rsi(close, 20)

// Detect crosses.
xUp = ta.crossover(r, 50)
xDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)

// Only generate entries when the trade's direction is allowed in inputs.
enterLong = detectLongsInput and xUp and (repaintInput or barstate.isconfirmed)
enterShort = detectShortsInput and xDn and (repaintInput or barstate.isconfirmed)
// Trigger the alerts only when the compound condition is met.
if enterLong
    alert("Go long (RSI is " + str.tostring(r, "#.00)"))
else if enterShort
    alert("Go short (RSI is " + str.tostring(r, "#.00)"))

plotchar(enterLong, "Go Long", "A", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(enterShort, "Go Short", "V", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)
hline(50)
plot(r)

Note how:

*   We create a compound condition that is met only when the user's selection allows for an entry in that direction.
    A long entry on a crossover of the centerline only triggers the alert when long entries have been enabled in the
    script's Inputs.

*   We offer the user to indicate his repainting preference. When he does not allow the calculations to repaint, we
    wait until the bar's confirmation to trigger the compound condition. This way, the alert and the marker only
    appear at the end of the realtime bar.

*   If a user of this script wanted to create two distinct script alerts from this script, i.e., one triggering only on
    longs, and one only on shorts, then he would need to:

    *   Select only "Detect Longs" in the inputs and create a first script alert on the script.
    *   Select only "Detect Shorts" in the Inputs and create another script alert on the script.

In strategies

`alert()` function calls can be used in strategies also, with the provision that strategies, by default, only execute on the
close of realtime bars. Unless `calc_on_every_tick = true` is used in the `strategy()` declaration statement, all
`alert()` calls will use the `alert.freq_once_per_bar_close` frequency, regardless of the argument used for
`freq`.

While script alerts on strategies will use order fill events to trigger alerts when the broker emulator fills orders,
`alert()` can be used advantageously to generate other alert events in strategies.

This strategy creates `alert()` function calls when RSI moves against the trade for three consecutive bars:

```pine
//@version=5
strategy("Strategy with selective `alert()` calls")
r = ta.rsi(close, 20)

// Detect crosses.
xUp = ta.crossover(r, 50)
xDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)
// Place orders on crosses.
if xUp
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)
else if xDn
    strategy.entry("Short", strategy.short)

// Trigger an alert when RSI diverges from our trade's direction.
divInLongTrade = strategy.position_size > 0 and ta.falling(r, 3)
divInShortTrade = strategy.position_size < 0 and ta.rising(r, 3)
if divInLongTrade
    alert("WARNING: Falling RSI", alert.freq_once_per_bar_close)
if divInShortTrade
    alert("WARNING: Rising RSI", alert.freq_once_per_bar_close)
plotchar(xUp, "Go Long", "A", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(xDn, "Go Short", "V", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(divInLongTrade, "WARNING: Falling RSI", ".", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(divInShortTrade, "WARNING: Rising RSI", ".", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)
hline(50)
plot(r)
```

If a user created a script alert from this strategy and included both order fill events and `alert()` function calls in his alert, the alert would trigger whenever an order is executed, or when one of the `alert()` calls was executed by the script on the realtime bar's closing iteration, i.e., when `barstate.isrealtime` and `barstate.isconfirmed` are both true. The `alert()` function events in the script would only trigger the alert when the realtime bar closes because `alert.freq_once_per_bar_close` is the argument used for the `freq` parameter in the `alert()` calls.

## Order fill events

When a script alert is created from an indicator, it can only trigger on `alert()` function calls. However, when a script alert is created from a strategy, the user can specify that order fill events also trigger the script alert. An order fill event is any event generated by the broker emulator which causes a simulated order to be executed. It is the equivalent of a trade order being filled by a broker/exchange. Orders are not necessarily executed when they are placed. In a strategy, the execution of orders can only be detected indirectly and after the fact, by analyzing changes in built-in variables such as `strategy.opentrades` or `strategy.position_size`. Script alerts configured on order fill events are thus useful in that they allow the triggering of alerts at the precise moment of an order's execution, before a script's logic can detect it.

Pine Script™ programmers can customize the alert message sent when specific orders are executed. While this is not a pre-requisite for order fill events to trigger, custom alert messages can be useful because they allow custom syntax to be included with alerts in order to route actual orders to a third-party execution engine, for example. Specifying custom alert messages for specific order fill events is done by means of the `alert_message` parameter in functions which can generate orders: `strategy.close()`, `strategy.entry()`, `strategy.exit()` and `strategy.order()`.

The argument used for the `alert_message` parameter is a “series string", so it can be constructed dynamically using any variable available to the script, as long as it is converted to string format.

Let's look at a strategy where we use the `alert_message` parameter in both our `strategy.entry()` calls:

```
//@version=5
strategy("Strategy using `alert_message`")
r = ta.rsi(close, 20)

// Detect crosses.
xUp = ta.crossover(r, 50)
xDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)
// Place order on crosses using a custom alert message for each.
if xUp
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long, stop = high, alert_message = "Stop-buy execut
else if xDn
    strategy.entry("Short", strategy.short, stop = low, alert_message = "Stop-sell exec

plotchar(xUp, "Go Long", "A", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(xDn, "Go Short", "▼", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)
hline(50)
plot(r)

Note that:
* We use the `stop` parameter in our strategy.entry() calls, which creates stop-buy and stop-sell orders. This entails that buy orders will only execute once price is higher than the high on the bar where the order is placed, and sell orders will only execute once price is lower than the low on the bar where the order is placed.
* The up/down arrows which we plot with plotchar() are plotted when orders are placed. Any number of bars may elapse before the order is actually executed, and in some cases the order will never be executed because price does not meet the required condition.
* Because we use the same `id` argument for all buy orders, any new buy order placed before a previous order's condition is met will replace that order. The same applies to sell orders.
* Variables included in the `alert_message` argument are evaluated when the order is executed, so when the alert triggers.

When the `alert_message` parameter is used in a strategy's order-generating `strategy.*()` function calls, script users must include the `{{strategy.order.alert_message}}` placeholder in the “Create Alert" dialog box's "Message” field when creating script alerts on order fill events. This is required so the `alert_message` argument used in the order-generating `strategy.*()` function calls is used in the message of alerts triggering on each order fill event. When only using the `{{strategy.order.alert_message}}` placeholder in the “Message” field and the `alert_message` parameter is present in only some of the order-generating `strategy.*()` function calls in your strategy, an empty string will replace the placeholder in the message of alerts triggered by any order-generating `strategy.*()` function call not using the `alert_message` parameter.

While other placeholders can be used in the "Create Alert" dialog box's "Message" field by users creating alerts on order fill events, they cannot be used in the argument of `alert_message`.

`alertcondition()` events
The `alertcondition()` function allows programmers to create individual `alertcondition` events in Pine Script™ indicators. One indicator may contain more than one `alertcondition()` call. Each call to `alertcondition()` in a script will create a corresponding alert selectable in the “Condition” dropdown menu of the “Create Alert” dialog box.

While the presence of `alertcondition()` calls in a Pine Script™ strategy script will not cause a compilation error, alerts cannot be created from them.

The `alertcondition()` function has the following signature:

```
alertcondition(condition, title, message)
```

condition
A "series bool" value (true or false) which determines when the alert will trigger. It is a required argument.
When the value is true the alert will trigger. When the value is false the alert will not trigger. Contrary to
alert() function calls, alertcondition() calls must start at column zero of a line, so cannot be placed in conditional
blocks.

title
A "const string" optional argument that sets the name of the alert condition as it will appear in the "Create
Alert" dialog box's "Condition" field in the charts Ul. If no argument is supplied, “Alert" will be used.

message
A "const string" optional argument that specifies the text message to display when the alert triggers. The text
will appear in the "Message” field of the "Create Alert” dialog box, from where script users can then modify it
when creating an alert. As this argument must be a "const string", it must be known at compilation time and
thus cannot vary bar to bar. It can, however, contain placeholders which will be replaced at runtime by dynamic
values that may change bar to bar. See this page's Placeholders section for a list.

The alertcondition() function does not include a freq parameter. The frequency of alertcondition() alerts is
determined by users in the "Create Alert" dialog box.

## Using one condition
Here is an example of code creating alertcondition() events:

```
//@version=5
indicator("`alertcondition()` on single condition")
r = ta.rsi (close, 20)

xUp = ta.crossover (r, 50)
xDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)

plot(r, "RSI")
hline (50)
plotchar(xUp, "Long", "A", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(xDn, "Short", "", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)

alertcondition (xUp, "Long Alert", "Go long")
alertcondition (xDn, "Short Alert", "Go short ")
```

Because we have two alertcondition() calls in our script, two different alerts will be available in the "Create Alert"
dialog box's "Condition” field: "Long Alert" and "Short Alert".

If we wanted to include the value of RSI when the cross occurs, we could not simply add its value to the message
string using str.tostring(r) , as we could in an alert() call or in an alert_message argument in a strategy. We
can, however, include it using a placeholder. This shows two alternatives:

```
alertcondition (xUp, "Long Alert", "Go long. RSI is {{plot_0}}")
alertcondition (xDn, "Short Alert", 'Go short. RSI is {{plot("RSI")}}')
```

Note that:
* The first line uses the {{plot_0}} placeholder, where the plot number corresponds to the order of the plot in
the script.
* The second line uses the {{plot("[plot_title]")}} type of placeholder, which must include the title
of the plot() call used in our script to plot RSI. Double quotes are used to wrap the plot's title inside the
{{plot("RSI")}} placeholder. This requires that we use single quotes to wrap the message string.
* Using one of these methods, we can include any numeric value that is plotted by our indicator, but as strings

cannot be plotted, no string variable can be used.

## Using compound conditions

If we want to offer script users the possiblity of creating a single alert from an indicator using multiple `alertcondition()` calls, we will need to provide options in the script's inputs through which users will indicate the conditions they want to trigger their alert before creating it.

This script demonstrates one way to do it:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("`alertcondition()` on multiple conditions")
detectLongsInput  = input.bool(true, "Detect Longs")
detectShortsInput = input.bool(true, "Detect Shorts")

r = ta.rsi(close, 20)
// Detect crosses.
xUp = ta.crossover(r, 50)
xDn = ta.crossunder(r, 50)
// Only generate entries when the trade's direction is allowed in inputs.
enterLong = detectLongsInput and xUp
enterShort = detectShortsInput and xDn

plot(r)
plotchar(enterLong, "Go Long", "A", location.bottom, color.lime, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(enterShort, "Go Short", "V", location.top, color.red, size = size.tiny)
hline(50)
// Trigger the alert when one of the conditions is met.
alertcondition(enterLong or enterShort, "Compound alert", "Entry")
```

Note how the `alertcondition()` call is allowed to trigger on one of two conditions. Each condition can only trigger the alert if the user enables it in the script's inputs before creating the alert.

## Placeholders

These placeholders can be used in the `message` argument of `alertcondition()` calls. They will be replaced with dynamic values when the alert triggers. They are the only way to include dynamic values (values that can vary bar to bar) in `alertcondition()` messages.

Note that users creating `alertcondition()` alerts from the "Create Alert" dialog box in the charts UI are also able to use these placeholders in the dialog box's "Message” field.

`{{exchange}}`
Exchange of the symbol used in the alert (NASDAQ, NYSE, MOEX, etc.). Note that for delayed symbols, the exchange will end with "_DL” or “_DLY.” For example, "NYMEX_DL.”

`{{interval}}`
Returns the timeframe of the chart the alert is created on. Note that Range charts are calculated based on 1m data, so the placeholder will always return "1" on any alert created on a Range chart.

`{{open}}, {{high}}, {{low}}, {{close}}, {{volume}}`
Corresponding values of the bar on which the alert has been triggered.

`{{plot_0}}, {{plot_1}},[...], {{plot_19}}`
Value of the corresponding plot number. Plots are numbered from zero to 19 in order of appearance in the script, so only one of the first 20 plots can be used. For example, the built-in "Volume” indicator has two output series: Volume and Volume MA, so you could use the following:

`alertcondition(volume > sma(volume,20), "Volume alert", "Volume ({{plot_0}}) > average`

`{{plot("[plot_title]")}}`
This placeholder can be used when one needs to refer to a plot using the `title` argument used in a `plot()` call.
Note that double quotation marks (`"`) must be used inside the placeholder to wrap the `title` argument. This
requires that a single quotation mark (`'`) be used to wrap the `message` string:

```
//@version=5
indicator("")
r = ta.rsi(close, 14)
xUp = ta.crossover(r, 50)
plot(r, "RSI", display = display.none)
alertcondition(xUp, "xUp alert", message = 'RSI is bullish at: {{plot("RSI")}}'
```

`{{ticker}}`
Ticker of the symbol used in the alert (AAPL, BTCUSD, etc.).

`{{time}}`
Returns the time at the beginning of the bar. Time is UTC, formatted as `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ`, so for
example: `2019-08-27T09:56:00Z`.

`{{timenow}}`
Current time when the alert triggers, formatted in the same way as `{{time}}`. The precision is to the nearest
second, regardless of the chart's timeframe.

## Avoiding repainting with alerts

The most common instances of repainting traders want to avoid with alerts are ones where they must prevent an alert
from triggering at some point during the realtime bar when it would not have triggered at its close. This can happen
when these conditions are met:

*   The calculations used in the condition triggering the alert can vary during the realtime bar. This will be the case
    with any calculation using `high`, `low` or `close`, for example, which includes almost all built-in indicators. It
    will also be the case with the result of any `request.security()` call using a higher timeframe than the chart's,
    when the higher timeframe's current bar has not closed yet.
*   The alert can trigger before the close of the realtime bar, so with any frequency other than “Once Per Bar
    Close".

The simplest way to avoid this type of repainting is to configure the triggering frequency of alerts so they only trigger
on the close of the realtime bar. There is no panacea; avoiding this type of repainting always entails waiting for
confirmed information, which means the trader must sacrifice immediacy to achieve reliability.

Note that other types of repainting such as those documented in our  section may not be preventable by
simply triggering alerts on the close of realtime bars.

# Backgrounds
The `bgcolor()` function changes the color of the script's background. If the script is running in `overlay = true` mode, then it will color the chart's background.

The function's signature is:

`bgcolor(color, offset, editable, show_last, title) => void`

Its `color` parameter allows a “series color” to be used for its argument, so it can be dynamically calculated in an expression.

If the correct transparency is not part of the color to be used, it can be be generated using the `color.new()` function.

Here is a script that colors the background of trading sessions (try it on 30min EURUSD, for example):

```
//@version=5
indicator("Session backgrounds", overlay = true)

// Default color constants using tranparency of 25.
BLUE_COLOR = #0050FF40
PURPLE_COLOR = #0000FF40
PINK_COLOR = #5000FF40
NO_COLOR = color (na)

// Allow user to change the colors.
preMarketColor = input.color (BLUE_COLOR, "Pre-market")
regSessionColor = input.color (PURPLE_COLOR, "Pre-market")
postMarketColor = input.color(PINK_COLOR, "Pre-market")

// Function returns `true` when the bar's time is
timeInRange(tf, session) =>
time(tf, session) != 0

// Function prints a message at the bottom-right of the chart.
f_print(_text) =>
    var table_t = table.new(position.bottom_right, 1, 1)
    table.cell( table_t, 0, 0, _text, bgcolor = color.yellow)

var chartIs30MinOrLess = timeframe.isseconds or (timeframe.isintraday and timeframe.mul <= 30)
sessionColor = if chartIs30MinOrLess
    switch
        timeInRange(timeframe.period, "0400-0930") => preMarketColor
        timeInRange(timeframe.period, "0930-1600") => regSessionColor
        timeInRange(timeframe.period, "1600-2000") => postMarketColor
        => NO_COLOR
else
    f_print("No background is displayed.\nChart timeframe must be <= 30min.")
    NO_COLOR

bgcolor(sessionColor)
```

Note that:

*   The script only works on chart timeframes of 30min or less. It prints an error message when the chart's timeframe is higher than 30min.
*   When the `if` structure's `else` branch is used because the chart's timeframe is incorrect, the local block returns the `NO_COLOR` color so that no background is displayed in that case.
*   We first initialize constants using our base colors, which include the `40` transparency in hex notation at the end. `40` in the hexadecimal notation on the reversed 00-FF scale for transparency corresponds to 75 in Pine Script™'s 0-100 decimal scale for transparency.
*   We provide color inputs allowing script users to change the default colors we propose.

In our next example, we generate a gradient for the background of a CCI line:

```
//@version=5
indicator("CCI Background")

bullColor = input.color(color.lime, "A ", inline = "1")
bearColor = input.color(color.fuchsia, "AA", inline = "1")

// Calculate CCI.
myCCI = ta.cci (hlc3, 20)
// Get relative position of CCI in last 100 bars, on a 0-100% scale.
myCCIPosition = ta.percentrank (myCCI, 100)
// Generate a bull gradient when position is 50-100%, bear gradient when position is 0-
backgroundColor = if myCCIPosition >= 50
    color.from_gradient(myCCIPosition, 50, 100, color.new(bullColor, 75), bullColor)
else
    color.from_gradient(myCCIPosition, 0, 50, bearColor, color.new(bearColor, 75))

// Wider white line background.
plot(myCCI, "CCI", color.white, 3)
// Think black line.
plot(myCCI, "CCI", color.black, 1)
// Zero level.
hline (0)
// Gradient background.
bgcolor (backgroundColor)
```

Note that:
*   We use the `ta.cci()` built-in function to calculate the indicator value.
*   We use the `ta.percentrank()` built-in function to calculate `myCCIPosition`, i.e., the percentage of past myCCI values in the last 100 bars that are below the current value of `myCCI`.
*   To calculate the gradient, we use two different calls of the `color.from_gradient()` built-in: one for the bull gradient when `myCCIPosition` is in the 50-100% range, which means that more past values are below its current value, and another for the bear gradient when `myCCIPosition` is in the 0-49.99% range, which means that more past values are above it.
*   We provide inputs so the user can change the bull/bear colors, and we place both color input widgets on the same line using `inline = "1"` in both `input.color()` calls.
*   We plot the CCI signal using two `plot()` calls to achieve the best contrast over the busy background: the first plot is a 3-pixel wide white background, the second `plot()` call plots the thin, 1-pixel wide black line.

See the  page for more examples of backgrounds.

User Manual • Concepts Bar coloring

# Bar coloring

The `barcolor()` function lets you color chart bars. It is the only Pine Script™ function that allows a script running in a pane to affect the chart.

The function's signature is:

`barcolor(color, offset, editable, show_last, title) => void`

The coloring can be conditional because the `color` parameter accepts “series color" arguments.

The following script renders inside and outside bars in different colors:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("barcolor example", overlay = true)
isUp = close > open
isDown = close <= open
isOutsideUp = high > high [1] and low < low [1] and isUp
isOutsideDown = high > high [1] and low < low [1] and isDown
isInside = high < high [1] and low > low [1]
barcolor(isInside ? color.yellow: isOutsideUp ? color.aqua : isOutsideDown ? color.purple : na)
```

Note that:

*   The `na` value leaves bars as is.
*   In the `barcolor()` call, we use embedded `?:` ternary operator expressions to select the color.

# Introduction

The `plotcandle()` built-in function is used to plot candles. `plotbar()` is used to plot conventional bars.

Both functions require four arguments that will be used for the OHLC prices (`open`, `high`, `low`, `close`) of the bars they will be plotting. If one of those is `na`, no bar is plotted.

# Plotting candles with `plotcandle()`

The signature of `plotcandle()` is:

`plotcandle(open, high, low, close, title, color, wickcolor, editable, show_last, border)`

This plots simple candles, all in blue, using the habitual OHLC values, in a separate pane:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Single-color candles")
plotcandle(open, high, low, close)
```

To color them green or red, we can use the following code:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Example 2")
paletteColor = close >= open ? color.lime : color.red
plotbar(open, high, low, close, color = paletteColor)
```

Note that the `color` parameter accepts "series color” arguments, so constant values such as `color.red`, `color.lime`, `"#FF9090"`, as well as expressions that calculate colors at runtime, as is done with the `paletteColor` variable here, will all work.

You can build bars or candles using values other than the actual OHLC values. For example you could calculate and plot smoothed candles using the following code, which also colors wicks depending on the position of `close` relative to the smoothed close (`c`) of our indicator:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Smoothed candles", overlay = true)
lenInput = input.int(9)
smooth (source, length) =>
    ta.sma (source, length)
o = smooth (open, lenInput)
h = smooth (high, lenInput)
l = smooth (low, lenInput)
c = smooth (close, lenInput)
ourWickColor = close > c ? color.green : color.red
plotcandle(o, h, l, c, wickcolor = ourWickColor)

You may find it useful to plot OHLC values taken from a higher timeframe. You can, for example, plot daily bars on an
intraday chart:

// NOTE: Use this script on an intraday chart.
//@version=5
indicator("Daily bars")

// Use gaps to only return data when the 1D timeframe completes, `na` otherwise.
[o, h, l, c] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", [open, high, low, close], gaps

var color UP_COLOR = color.silver
var color DN_COLOR = color.blue
color wickColor = c >= o ? UP_COLOR : DN_COLOR
color bodyColor = c >= o ? color.new(UP_COLOR, 70) : color.new(DN_COLOR, 70)
// Only plot candles on intraday timeframes,
// and when non `na` values are returned by `request.security()` because a HTF has comp
plotcandle(timeframe.isintraday ? na : na, h, l, c, color = bodyColor, wickcolor = wickColor)
```

Note that:

*   We show the script's plot after having used "Visual Order/Bring to Front" from the script's "More" menu. This causes our script's candles to appear on top of the chart's candles.
*   The script will only display candles when two conditions are met:
    *   The chart is using an intraday timeframe (see the check on `timeframe.isintraday` in the `plotcandle()` call). We do this because it's not useful to show a daily value on timeframes higher or equal to 1D.
    *   The `request.security()` function returns non `na` values (see `gaps = barmerge.gaps_on` in the function call).
*   We use a tuple (`[open, high, low, close]`) with `request.security()` to fetch four values in one call.
*   We use `var` to declare our `UP COLOR` and `DN COLOR` color constants on bar zero only. We use constants because those colors are used in more than one place in our code. This way, if we need to change them, we need only do so in one place.
*   We create a lighter transparency for the body of our candles in the `bodyColor` variable initialization, so they don't obstruct the chart's candles.

## Plotting bars with `plotbar()`

The signature of `plotbar()` is:

`plotbar(open, high, low, close, title, color, editable, show_last, display)`

Note that `plotbar()` has no parameter for `bordercolor` or `wickcolor`, as there are no borders or wicks on conventional bars.

This plots conventional bars using the same coloring logic as in the second example of the previous section:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Dual-color bars")
paletteColor = close >= open ? color.lime : color.red
plotbar(open, high, low, close, color = paletteColor)
```

# Bar states

• Introduction
• Bar state built-in variables
    * `barstate.isfirst`
    * `barstate.islast`
    * `barstate.ishistory`
    * `barstate.isrealtime`
    * `barstate.isnew`
    * `barstate.isconfirmed`
    * `barstate.islastconfirmedhistory`
• Example

# Introduction

A set of built-in variables in the `barstate` namespace allow your script to detect different properties of the bar on which the script is currently executing.

These states can be used to restrict the execution or the logic of your code to specific bars.

Some built-ins return information on the trading session the current bar belongs to. They are explained in the Session states section.

# Bar state built-in variables

Note that while indicators and libraries run on all price or volume updates in real time, strategies not using `calc_on_every_tick` will not; they will only execute when the realtime bar closes. This will affect the detection of bar states in that type of script. On open markets, for example, this code will not display a background until the realtime closes because that is when the strategy runs:

```
//@version=5
strategy("S")
bgcolor(barstate.islast ? color.silver : na)
```

`barstate.isfirst`

`barstate.isfirst` is only `true` on the dataset's first bar, i.e., when `bar_index` is zero.

It can be useful to initialize variables on the first bar only, e.g.:

```
// Declare array and set its values on the first bar only.
FILL_COLOR = color.green
var fillColors = array.new_color(0)
if barstate.isfirst
    // Initialize the array elements with progressively lighter shades of the fill colo
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 70))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 75))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 80))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 85))
    array.push(fillColors, color.new(FILL_COLOR, 90))

`barstate.islast`
barstate.islast is `true` if the current bar is the last one on the chart, whether that bar is a realtime bar or not.

It can be used to restrict the execution of code to the chart's last bar, which is often useful when drawing lines,
labels or tables. Here, we use it to determine when to update a label which we want to appear only on the last bar.
We create the label only once and then update its properties using `label.set_*()` functions because it is more
efficient:

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
// Create label on the first bar only.
var label hiLabel = label.new(na, na, "")
// Update the label's position and text on the last bar,
// including on all realtime bar updates.
if barstate.islast
    label.set_xy(hiLabel, bar_index, high)
    label.set_text(hiLabel, str.tostring(high, format.mintick))
```

`barstate.ishistory`
barstate.ishistory is `true` on all historical bars. It can never be `true` on a bar when `barstate.isrealtime` is also
`true`, and it does not become `true` on a realtime bar's closing update, when `barstate.isconfirmed` becomes `true`.
On closed markets, it can be `true` on the same bar where `barstate.islast` is also `true`.

`barstate.isrealtime`
barstate.isrealtime is `true` if the current data update is a real-time bar update, `false` otherwise (thus it is
historical). Note that `barstate.islast` is also `true` on all realtime bars.

`barstate.isnew`
barstate.isnew is `true` on all historical bars and on the realtime bar's first (opening) update.

All historical bars are considered new bars because the Pine Script™ runtime executes your script on each bar
sequentially, from the chart's first bar in time, to the last. Each historical bar is thus discovered by your script as it
executes, bar to bar.

barstate.isnew can be useful to reset `varip` variables when a new realtime bar comes in. The following code will reset
`updateNo` to 1 on all historical bars and at the beginning of each realtime bar. It calculates the number of realtime
updates during each realtime bar:

```
//@version=5
indicator("")
updateNo() =>
    varip int updateNo = na
    if barstate.isnew
        updateNo:= 1
    else
        updateNo += 1
plot(updateNo())

`barstate.isconfirmed`
`barstate.isconfirmed` is `true` on all historical bars and on the last (closing) update of a realtime bar.
It can be useful to avoid repainting by requiring the realtime bar to be closed before a condition can become `true`.
We use it here to hold plotting of our RSI until the realtime bar closes and becomes an elapsed realtime bar. It will
plot on historical bars because `barstate.isconfirmed` is always `true` on them:

```
//@version=5
indicator("")
myRSI = ta.rsi(close, 20)
plot(barstate.isconfirmed ? myRSI : na)
```

`barstate.isconfirmed` will not work when used in a `request.security()` call.

`barstate.islastconfirmedhistory`
`barstate.islastconfirmedhistory` is `true` if the script is executing on the dataset's last bar when the market is closed,
or on the bar immediately preceding the realtime bar if the market is open.

It can be used to detect the first realtime bar with `barstate.islastconfirmedhistory[1]`, or to postpone
server-intensive calculations until the last historical bar, which would otherwise be undetectable on open markets.

Example
Here is an example of a script using `barstate.*` variables:

• The realtime bar is red because it is its first execution, because `barstate.isnew` is `true` and `barstate.ishistory` is no longer `true`, so our `switch` structure determing our color uses the `barstate.isnew => color.red` branch. This will usually not last long because on the next update `barstate.isnew` will no longer be `true` so the label's color will turn yellow.
• The label of elapsed realtime bars is orange because those bars were not historical bars when they closed. Accordingly, the `barstate.ishistory => color.silver` branch in the `switch` structure was not executed, but the next one, `barstate.isconfirmed => color.orange` was.

This last example shows how the realtime bar's label will turn yellow after the first execution on the bar. This is the way the label will usually appear on realtime bars:

Chart information

© Copyright 2023, TradingView.

User Manual • Concepts Chart information

Chart information

• Introduction
• Prices and volume
• Symbol information
• Chart timeframe
• Session information

Introduction

The way scripts can obtain information about the chart and symbol they are currently running on is through a subset of Pine Script ™'s . The ones we cover here allow scripts to access information relating to:

• The chart's prices and volume
• The chart's symbol
• The chart's timeframe
• The session (or time period) the symbol trades on

Prices and volume

The Pine Script™ built-ins for OHLCV values are:

• `open`: the bar's opening price.
• `high`: the bar's highest price, or the highest price reached during the realtime bar's elapsed time.
• `low`: the bar's lowest price, or the lowest price reached during the realtime bar's elapsed time.
• `close`: the bar's closing price, or the current price in the realtime bar.
• `volume`: the volume traded during the bar, or the volume traded during the realtime bar's elapsed time. The unit of volume information varies with the instrument. It is in shares for stocks, in lots for forex, in contracts for futures, in the base currency for crypto, etc.

Other values are available through:

• `hl2`: the average of the bar's high and low values.
• `hlc3`: the average of the bar's high, low and close values.
• `ohlc4`: the average of the bar's open, high, low and close values.

On historical bars, the values of the above variables do not vary during the bar because only OHLCV information is available on them. When running on historical bars, scripts execute on the bar's `close`, when all the bar's information is known and cannot change during the script's execution on the bar.

Realtime bars are another story altogether. When indicators (or strategies using `calc_on_every_tick = true`) run in realtime, the values of the above variables (except `open`) will vary between successive iterations of the script on the realtime bar, because they represent their current value at one point in time during the progress of the
realtime bar. This may lead to one form of repainting. See the page on Pine Script ™'s execution model for more
details.

The [] history-referencing operator can be used to refer to past values of the built-in variables, e.g., `close[1]`
refers to the value of `close` on the previous bar, relative to the particular bar the script is executing on.

## Symbol information

Built-in variables in the `syminfo` namespace provide scripts with information on the symbol of the chart the script is
running on. This information changes every time a script user changes the chart's symbol. The script then re-executes
on all the chart's bars using the new values of the built-in variables:
* `syminfo.basecurrency`: the base currency, e.g., “BTC” in “BTCUSD”, or “EUR” in “EURUSD”.
* `syminfo.currency`: the quote currency, e.g., "USD” in “BTCUSD”, or “CAD” in “USDCAD".
* `syminfo.description`: The long description of the symbol.
* `syminfo.mintick`: The symbol's tick value, or the minimum increment price can move in. Not to be confused with
pips or points. On “ES1!” (“S&P 500 E-Mini”) the tick size is 0.25 because that is the minimal increment the
price moves in.
* `syminfo.pointvalue`: The point value is the multiple of the underlying asset determining a contract's value. On
"ES1!" ("S&P 500 E-Mini") the point value is 50, so a contract is worth 50 times the price of the instrument.
* `syminfo.prefix`: The prefix is the exchange or broker's identifier: “NASDAQ” or “BATS” for "AAPL",
"CME_MINI_DL" for "ES1!".
* `syminfo.root`: It is the ticker's prefix for structured tickers like those of futures. It is "ES" for "ES1!”, “ZW" for
"ZW1!".
* `syminfo.session`: It reflects the session setting on the chart for that symbol. If the "Chart
settings/Symbol/Session" field is set to "Extended", it will only return "extended" if the symbol and the user's
feed allow for extended sessions. It is rarely displayed and used mostly as an argument to the `session`
parameter in `ticker.new()`.
* `syminfo.ticker`: It is the symbol's name, without the exchange part (`syminfo.prefix`): "BTCUSD", "AAPL”, “ES1!",
"USDCAD".
* `syminfo.tickerid`: This string is rarely displayed. It is mostly used as an argument for `request.security()`'s
`symbol` parameter. It includes session, prefix and ticker information.
* `syminfo.timezone`: The timezone the symbol is traded in. The string is an IANA time zone database name (e.g.,
"America/New_York").
* `syminfo.type`: The type of market the symbol belongs to. The values are "stock", "futures", "index", "forex",
"crypto", "fund", "dr", "cfd", "bond", "warrant”, “structured" and "right".

This script will display the values of those built-in variables on the chart:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("`syminfo.*` built-ins", "", true)
printTable (txtLeft, txtRight) =>
var table t = table.new(position.middle_right, 2, 1)
table.cell(t, 0, 0, txtLeft, bgcolor = color.yellow, text halign = text.align_right
table.cell(t, 1, 0, txtRight, bgcolor = color.yellow, text_halign = text.align_lef

nl = "\n"
left =
"syminfo.basecurrency: " + nl +
"syminfo.currency: " + nl +
"syminfo.description: " + nl +
"syminfo.mintick: " + nl +
"syminfo.pointvalue: " + nl +
"syminfo.prefix: " + nl +
"syminfo.root: " + nl +
"syminfo.session: " + nl +
"syminfo.ticker: " + nl +
"syminfo.tickerid: " + nl +
"syminfo.timezone: " + nl +
"syminfo.type: " + nl

right =
syminfo.basecurrency + nl +
syminfo.currency + nl +
syminfo.description + nl +
str.tostring(syminfo.mintick) + nl +
str.tostring(syminfo.pointvalue) + nl +
syminfo.prefix + nl +
syminfo.root + nl +
syminfo.session + nl +
syminfo.ticker + nl +
syminfo.tickerid + nl +
syminfo.timezone + nl +
syminfo.type

printTable (left, right)
```

## Chart timeframe
A script can obtain information on the type of timeframe used on the chart using these built-ins, which all return a "simple bool" result:

*   timeframe.isseconds
*   timeframe.isminutes
*   timeframe.isintraday
*   timeframe.isdaily
*   timeframe.isweekly
*   timeframe.ismonthly
*   timeframe.isdwm

Two additional built-ins return more specific timeframe information:

*   timeframe.multiplier returns a "simple int" containing the multiplier of the timeframe unit. A chart timeframe of one hour will return `60` because intraday timeframes are expressed in minutes. A 30sec timeframe will return `30` (seconds), a daily chart will return `1` (day), a quarterly chart will return `3` (months), and a yearly chart will return `12` (months). The value of this variable cannot be used as an argument to `timeframe` parameters in built-in functions, as they expect a string in timeframe specifications format.
*   timeframe.period returns a string in Pine Script™'s timeframe specification format.

See the page on  for more information.

## Session information

Session information is available in different forms:

*   The `syminfo.session` built-in variable returns a value that is either `session.regular` or `session.extended`. It reflects the session setting on the chart for that symbol. If the "Chart settings/Symbol/Session" field is set to "Extended", it will only return "extended" if the symbol and the user's feed allow for extended sessions. It is used when a session type is expected, for example as the argument for the `session` parameter in `ticker.new()`.
*   Session state built-ins provide information on the trading session a bar belongs to.

# Introduction

Script visuals can play a critical role in the usability of the indicators we write in Pine Script™. Well-designed plots and drawings make indicators easier to use and understand. Good visual designs establish a visual hierarchy that allows the more important information to stand out, and the less important one to not get in the way.

Using colors in Pine Script™ can be as simple as you want, or as involved as your concept requires. The 4,294,967,296 possible assemblies of color and transparency available in Pine Script™ can be applied to:

*   Any element you can plot or draw in an indicator's visual space, be it lines, fills, text or candles.
*   The background of a script's visual space, whether the script is running in its own pane, or in overlay mode on the chart.
*   The color of bars or the body of candles appearing on a chart.

A script can only color the elements it places in its own visual space. The only exception to this rule is that a pane indicator can color chart bars or candles.

Pine Script™ has built-in colors such as `color.green`, as well as functions like `color.rgb()` which allow you to dynamically generate any color in the RGBA color space.

# Transparency

Each color in Pine Script™ is defined by four values:

• Its red, green and blue components (0-255), following the RGB color model.
• Its transparency (0-100), often referred to as the Alpha channel outside Pine Script™, as defined in the RGBA color model. Even though transparency in Pine Script™ is expressed in the 0-100 range, its value can be a "float" when used in functions, which gives you access to the 256 underlying values of the alpha channel.
The transparency of a color defines how opaque it is: zero is fully opaque, 100 makes the color-whichever it is- invisible. Modulating transparency can be crucial in more involved color visuals or when using backgrounds, to control which colors dominate the others, and how they mix together when superimposed.

## Z-index

When you place elements in a script's visual space, they have relative depth on the z axis; some will appear on top of others. The z-index is a value that represents the position of elements on the z axis. Elements with the highest z- index appear on top.

Elements drawn in Pine Script™ are divided in groups. Each group has its own position in the z space, and within the same group, elements created last in the script's logic will appear on top of other elements from the same group. An element of one group cannot be placed outside the region of the z space attributed to its group, so a plot can never appear on top of a table, for example, because tables have the highest z-index.

This lists the groups of visual elements in Pine Script™, ordered by increasing z-index, so background colors are always at the bottom of z space, and tables will always appear on top of all other elements:

• Background colors
• Plots
• Hlines
• Fills
• Boxes
• Labels
• Lines
• Tables

Note that by using `explicit_plot_zorder = true` in `indicator()` or `strategy()`, you can control the relative z- index of `plot()`, `hline()` and `fill()` visuals using their sequential order in the script.

## Constant colors

There are 17 built-in colors in Pine Script™. This table lists their names, hexadecimal equivalent, and RGB values as arguments to `color.rgb()`:

Name | Hex | RGB values
------- | -------- | --------
color.aqua | #00BCD4 | color.rgb(0, 188, 212)
color.black | #363A45 | color.rgb(54, 58, 69)

color.white | #FFFFFF | color.rgb(255, 255, 255)
color.yellow | #FFEB3B | color.rgb(255, 235, 59)

In the following script, all plots use the same `color.olive` color with a transparency of 40, but expressed in different ways. All five methods are functionally equivalent:

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
// Transparency (%2393393) is included in the hex value.
plot(ta.sma (close, 10), "10", #80800099)
// Transparency is included in the color-generating function's arguments.
plot(ta.sma (close, 30), "30", color.new(color.olive, 40))
plot(ta.sma (close, 50), "50", color.rgb(128, 128, 0, 40))
// Use `transp` parameter (deprecated and advised against)
plot(ta.sma(close, 70), "70", color.olive, transp = 40)
plot(ta.sma (close, 90), "90", %23808000, transp = 40)
```

**Note**

The last two `plot()` calls specify transparency using the `transp` parameter. This use should be avoided as the `transp` is deprecated in Pine Script ™ v5. Using the `transp` parameter to define transparency is not as flexible because it requires an argument of input `integer` type, which entails it must be known before the script is executed, and so cannot be calculated dynamically, as your script executes bar to bar. Additionally, if you use a `color` argument that already includes transparency information, as is done in the next three `plot()` calls, any argument used for the `transp` parameter would have no effect. This is also true for other functions with a `transp` parameter.

The colors in the previous script do not vary as the script executes bar to bar. Sometimes, however, colors need to be created as the script executes on each bar because they depend on conditions that are unknown at compile time, or when the script begins execution on bar zero. For those cases, Pine Script ™ programmers have two options:

1.  Use conditional statements to select colors from a few pre-determined base colors.
2.  Build new colors dynamically, by calculating them as the script executes bar to bar, to implement color gradients, for example.

**Conditional coloring**

Let's say you want to color a moving average in different colors, depending on some conditions you define. To do so, you can use a conditional statement that will select a different color for each of your states. Let's start by coloring a moving average in a bull color when it's rising, and in a bear color when it's not:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Conditional colors", "", true)
```

```
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length", minval = 2)
color maBullColorInput = input.color(color.green, "Bull")
color maBearColorInput = input.color(color.maroon, "Bear")
float ma = ta.sma(close, lengthInput)
// Define our states.
bool maRising = ta.rising(ma, 1)
// Build our color.
color c_ma = maRising ? maBullColorInput : maBearColorInput
plot(ma, "MA", c_ma, 2)
```
Note that:

*   We provide users of our script a selection of colors for our bull/bear colors.
*   We define an `maRising` boolean variable which will hold `true` when the moving average is higher on the current bar than it was on the last.
*   We define a `c_ma` color variable that is assigned one of our two colors, depending on the value of the `maRising` boolean. We use the `?:` ternary operator to write our conditional statement.

You can also use conditional colors to avoid plotting under certain conditions. Here, we plot high and low pivots using a line, but we do not want to plot anything when a new pivot comes in, to avoid the joints that would otherwise appear in pivot transitions. To do so, we test for pivot changes and use `na` as the color value when a change is detected, so that no line is plotted on that bar:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Conditional colors", "", true)
```

```
int legsInput = input.int(5, "Pivot Legs", minval = 1)
color pHiColorInput = input.color(color.olive, "High pivots")
color pLoColorInput = input.color(color.orange, "Low pivots")
// Intialize the pivot level variables.
var float pHi = na
var float pLo = na
// When a new pivot is detected, save its value.
pHi := nz(ta.pivothigh(legsInput, legsInput), pHi)
pLo := nz(ta.pivotlow(legsInput, legsInput), pLo)
// When a new pivot is detected, do not plot a color.
plot(pHi, "High", ta.change(pHi) ? na : pHiColorInput, 2, plot.style_line)
plot(pLo, "Low", ta.change(pLo) ? na : pLoColorInput, 2, plot.style_line)
```
To undertand how this code works, one must first know that `ta.pivothigh()` and `ta.pivotlow()`, used as they are here without an argument to the `source` parameter, will return a value when they find a `high/low` pivot, otherwise they return `na`.

When we test the value returned by the pivot function for `na` using the `nz()` function, we allow the value returned to

be assigned to the `pHi` or `pLo` variables only when it is not `na`, otherwise the previous value of the variable is
simply reassigned to it, which has no impact on its value. Keep in mind that previous values of `pHi` and `pLo` are
preserved bar to bar because we use the `var` keyword when initializing them, which causes the initialization to only
occur on the first bar.

All that's left to do next is, when we plot our lines, to insert a ternary conditional statement that will yield `na` for the
color when the pivot value changes, or the color selected in the script's inputs when the pivot level does not change.

## Calculated colors

Using functions like `color.new()`, `color.rgb()` and `color.from_gradient()`, one can build colors on the fly, as the script
executes bar to bar.

`color.new()` is most useful when you need to generate different transparency levels from a base color.

`color.rgb()` is useful when you need to build colors dynamically from red, green, blue, or tranparency components.
While `color.rgb()` creates a color, its sister functions `color.r()`, `color.g()`, `color.b()` and `color.t()` can be used to extract
the red, green, blue or transparency values from a color, which can in turn be used to generate a variant.

`color.from_gradient()` is useful to create linear gradients between two base colors. It determines which intermediary
color to use by evaluating a source value against minimum and maximum values.

## color.new()

Let's put `color.new(color, transp)` to use to create different transparencies for volume columns using one of two
bull/bear base colors:



```
color volumeColor = color.new(close > open ? bullColorInput: bearColorInput, transparency)
plot(volume, "Volume", volumeColor, 1, plot.style_columns)
```

Note that:
* In the next to last line of our script, we dynamically calculate the column color by varying both the base color used, depending on whether the bar is up or down, and the transparency level, which is calculated from the cumulative rises or falls of volume.
* We offer the script user control over not only the base bull/bear colors used, but also on the number of brightness levels we use. We use this value to determine the maximum number of rises or falls we will track. Giving users the possiblity to manage this value allows them to adapt the indicator's visuals to the timeframe or market they use.
* We take care to control the maximum level of transparency we use so that it never goes higher than 80. This ensures our colors always retain some visibility.
* We also set the minimum value for the number of levels to 1 in the inputs. When the user selects 1, the volume columns will be either in bull or bear color of maximum brightness-or transparency zero.

## color.rgb()

In our next example we use color.rgb(red, green, blue, transp) to build colors from RGBA values. We use the result in a holiday season gift for our friends, so they can bring their TradingView charts to parties:

![chart]

```
//@version=5
indicator("Holiday candles", "", true)
float r = math.random(0, 255)
float g = math.random(0, 255)
float b = math.random(0, 255)
float t = math.random(0, 100)
color holidayColor = color.rgb(r, g, b, t)
plotcandle(open, high, low, close, color = holidayColor, wickcolor = holidayColor, bordercolor = holidayColor)
```

Note that:
* We generate values in the zero to 255 range for the red, green and blue channels, and in the zero to 100 range for transparency. Also note that because `math.random()` returns float values, the float 0.0-100.0 range provides access to the full 0-255 transparency values of the underlying alpha channel.
* We use the `math.random(min, max, seed)` function to generate pseudo-random values. We do not use an argument for the third parameter of the function: `seed`. Using it is handy when you want to ensure the repeatability of the function's results. Called with the same seed, it will produce the same sequence of values.

# color.from_gradient()

Our last examples of color calculations will use `color.from_gradient(value, bottom_value, top_value, bottom_color, top_color)`. Let's first use it in its simplest form, to color a CCI signal in a version of the indicator that otherwise looks like the built-in:



```pine
//@version=5
indicator(title="CCI line gradient", precision=2, timeframe="")
var color GOLD_COLOR  = #CCCC00
var color VIOLET_COLOR = #AA00FF
var color BEIGE_COLOR = #9C6E1B
float srcInput      = input.source(close, title="Source")
int lenInput        = input.int(20, "Length", minval = 5)
color bullColorInput  = input.color(GOLD_COLOR,  "Bull")
color bearColorInput  = input.color(BEIGE_COLOR, "Bear")
float signal        = ta.cci(srcInput, lenInput)
color signalColor   = color.from_gradient(signal, -200, 200, bearColorInput, bullColorInput)
plot(signal, "CCI", signalColor)
bandTopPlotID   = hline(100, "Upper Band", color.silver, hline.style_dashed)
bandBotPlotID   = hline(-100, "Lower Band", color.silver, hline.style_dashed)
fill(bandTopPlotID, bandBotPlotID, color.new(BEIGE_COLOR, 90), "Background")
```

Note that:

*   To calculate the gradient, `color.from_gradient()` requires minimum and maximum values against which the argument used for the `value` parameter will be compared. The fact that we want a gradient for an unbounded signal like CCI (i.e., without fixed boundaries such as RSI, which always oscillates between 0-100), does not entail we cannot use `color.from_gradient()`. Here, we solve our conundrum by providing values of -200 and 200 as arguments. They do not represent the real minimum and maximum values for CCI, but they are at levels from which we do not mind the colors no longer changing, as whenever the series is outside the `bottom_value` and `top_value` limits, the colors used for `bottom_color` and `top_color` will apply.
*   The color progression calculated by `color.from_gradient()` is linear. If the value of the series is halfway between the `bottom_value` and `top_value` arguments, the generated color's RGBA components will also be halfway between those of `bottom color` and `top color`.
*   Many common indicator calculations are available in Pine Script ™ as built-in functions. Here we use `ta.cci()` instead of calculating it the long way.

The argument used for `value` in `color.from_gradient()` does not necessarily have to be the value of the line we are calculating. Anything we want can be used, as long as arguments for `bottom_value` and `top_value` can be supplied. Here, we enhance our CCI indicator by coloring the band using the number of bars since the signal has been above/below the centerline:

```
//@version=5
indicator(title="CCI line gradient", precision=2, timeframe="")
var color GOLD COLOR = #CCCC00
var color VIOLET COLOR = #2AA00FF
var color GREEN_BG_COLOR = color.new(color.green, 70)
var color RED_BG_COLOR = color.new(color.maroon, 70)

float srcInput = input.source(close, "Source")
int lenInput = input.int(20, "Length", minval = 5)
int stepsInput = input.int(50, "Gradient levels", minval = 1)
color bullColorInput = input.color(GOLD_COLOR, "Line: Bull", inline = "11")
color bearColorInput = input.color(VIOLET_COLOR, "Bear", inline = "11")
color bullBgColorInput = input.color(GREEN_BG_COLOR, "Background: Bull", inline = "12")
color bearBgColorInput = input.color(RED_BG_COLOR, "Bear", inline = "12")

// Plot colored signal line.
float signal = ta.cci(srcInput, lenInput)
color signalColor = color.from_gradient(signal, -200, 200, color.new(bearColorInput, 0), color.new(bullColorInput, 0))
plot(signal, "CCI", signalColor, 2)

// Detect crosses of the centerline.
bool signalX = ta.cross(signal, 0)
// Count no of bars since cross. Capping it to the no of steps from inputs.
int gradientStep = math.min(stepsInput, nz(ta.barssince(signalX)))
// Choose bull/bear end color for the gradient.
color endColor = signal > 0 ? bullBgColorInput : bearBgColorInput
// Get color from gradient going from no color to `c_endColor`
color bandColor = color.from_gradient(gradientStep, 0, stepsInput, na, endColor)
bandTopPlotID = hline(100, "Upper Band", color.silver, hline.style_dashed)
bandBotPlotID = hline(-100, "Lower Band", color.silver, hline.style_dashed)
fill(bandTopPlotID, bandBotPlotID, bandColor, title = "Band")
```

Note that:

*   The signal plot uses the same base colors and gradient as in our previous example. We have however increased the width of the line from the default 1 to 2. It is the most important component of our visuals; increasing its width is a way to give it more prominence, and ensure users are not distracted by the band, which has become busier than it was in its original, flat beige color.
*   The fill must remain unobtrusive for two reasons. First, it is of secondary importance to the visuals, as it provides complementary information, i.e., the duration for which the signal has been in bull/bear territory. Second, since fills have a greater z-index than plots, the fill will cover the signal plot. For these reasons, we make the fill's base colors fairly transparent, at 70, so they do not mask the plots. The gradient used for the band starts with no color at all (see the `na` used as the argument to `bottom_color` in the `color.from_gradient()` call), and goes to the base bull/bear colors from the inputs, which the conditional, `c_endColor` color variable contains.
*   We provide users with distinct bull/bear color selections for the line and the band.
*   When we calculate the `gradientStep` variable, we use `nz()` on `ta.barssince()` because in early bars of the dataset, when the condition tested has not occurred yet, `ta.barssince()` will return `na`. Because we use `nz()`, the value returned is replaced with zero in those cases.

# Mixing transparencies

In this example we take our CCI indicator in another direction. We will build dynamically adjusting extremes zone
buffers using a Donchian Channel (historical highs/lows) calculated from the CCI. We build the top/bottom bands by
making them 1/4 the height of the DC. We will use a dynamically adjusting lookback to calculate the DC. To modulate
the lookback, we will calculate a simple measure of volatility by keeping a ratio of a short-period ATR to a long one.
When that ratio is higher than 50 of its last 100 values, we consider the volatility high. When the volatility is
high/low, we decrease/increase the lookback.

Our aim is to provide users of our indicator with:

*   The CCI line colored using a bull/bear gradient, as we illustrated in our most recent examples.
*   The top and bottom bands of the Donchian Channel, filled in such a way that their color darkens as a historical
    high/low becomes older and older.
*   A way to appreciate the state of our volatility measure, which we will do by painting the background with one
    color whose intensity increases when volatility increases.

This is what our indicator looks like using the light theme:

CCI DC

And with the dark theme:

CCI DO

```
//@version=5
indicator("CCI DC", precision = 6)
color GOLD_COLOR = #CCCC00ff
color VIOLET_COLOR = #2AA00FFff
int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length", minval = 5)
color bullColorInput = input.color(GOLD_COLOR, "Bull")
color bearColorInput = input.color(VIOLET_COLOR, "Bear")

// Function clamps `val` between `min` and `max`
clamp (val, min, max) =>
    math.max(min, math.min(max, val))

// Volatility expressed as 0-100 value.
float v = ta.atr (lengthInput / 5) / ta.atr (lengthInput * 5)
float vPct = ta.percentrank(v, lengthInput * 5)

// Calculate dynamic lookback for DC. It increases/decreases on low/high volatili
bool highVolatility = vPct > 50
var int lookBackMin = lengthInput * 2
var int lookBackMax = lengthInput * 10
var float lookBack = math.avg (lookBackMin, lookBackMax)
lookBack += highVolatility ? -2 : 2
lookBack := clamp (lookBack, lookBackMin, lookBackMax)

// Dynamic lookback length Donchian channel of signal.
float signal = ta.cci(close, lengthInput)
// `lookBack` is a float; need to cast it to int to be used a length.
float hiTop = ta.highest(signal, int(lookBack))
float loBot = ta.lowest ( signal, int(lookBack))
// Get margin of 25% of the DC height to build high and low bands.
float margin = (hiTop - loBot) / 4
float hiBot = hiTop - margin
float loТор = loBot + margin
// Center of DC.
float center = math.avg (hiTop, loBot)

// Create colors.
color signalColor = color.from_gradient(signal, -200, 200, bearColorInput, bullColorInput)
// Bands: Calculate transparencies so the longer since the hi/lo has changed,
// the darker the color becomes. Cap highest transparency to 90.
float hiTransp = clamp (100 - (100 * math.max(1, nz(ta.barssince(ta.change (hiTop)) + 1)) / lookBack), 60, 90)
float loTransp = clamp (100 - (100 * math.max(1, nz(ta.barssince(ta.change (loBot)) + 1)) / lookBack), 60, 90)
color hiColor = color.new(bullColorInput, hiTransp)
color loColor = color.new(bearColorInput, loTransp)
// Background: Rescale the 0-100 range of `vPct` to 0-25 to create 75-100 transparencie
color bgColor = color.new(color.gray, 100 - (vPct / 4))

// Plots
// Invisible lines for band fills.
hiTopPlotID = plot(hiTop, color = na)
hiBotPlotID = plot (hiBot, color = na)
loTopPlotID = plot(loTop, color = na)
loBotPlotID = plot (loBot, color = na)
// Plot signal and centerline.
p_signal = plot(signal, "CCI", signalColor, 2)
plot(center, "Centerline", color.silver, 1)
// Fill the bands.
fill (hiTopPlotID, hiBotPlotID, hiColor)
fill(loTopPlotID, loBotPlotID, loColor)

// Background.
bgcolor (bgColor)
```

Note that:
* We clamp the transparency of the background to a 100-75 range so that it doesn't overwhelm. We also use a neutral color that will not distract too much. The darker the background is, the higher our measure of volatility.
* We also clamp the transparency values for the band fills between 60 and 90. We use 90 so that when a new high/low is found and the gradient resets, the starting transparency makes the color somewhat visible. We do not use a transparency lower than 60 because we don't want those bands to hide the signal line.
* We use the very handy `ta.percentrank()` function to generate a 0-100 value from our ATR ratio measuring volatility. It is useful to convert values whose scale is unknown into known values that can be used to produce transparencies.
* Because we must clamp values three times in our script, we wrote an `f_clamp()` function, instead of explicitly coding the logic three times.

## Tips

## Designing usable colors schemes

If you write scripts intended for other traders, try to avoid colors that will not work well in some environments, whether it be for plots, labels, tables or fills. At a minimum, test your visuals to ensure they perform satisfactorily with both the light and dark TradingView themes; they are the most commonly used. Colors such as black and white, for example, should be avoided.

Build the appropriate inputs to provide script users the flexibility to adapt your script's visuals to their particular environments.

Take care to build a visual hierarchy of the colors you use that matches the relative importance of your script's visual components. Good designers understand how to achieve the optimal balance of color and weight so the eye is naturally drawn to the most important elements of the design. When you make everything stand out, nothing does. Make room for some elements to stand out by toning down the visuals surrounding it.

Providing a selection of color presets in your inputs rather than a single color that can be changed can help color-challenged users. Our Technical Ratings demonstrates one way of achieving this. The Pine Script™ Color Magic and Chart Theme Simulator script provides a good selection of base colors to build from.

## Plot crisp lines

It is best to use zero transparency to plot the important lines in your visuals, to keep them crisp. This way, they will show through fills more precisely. Keep in mind that fills have a higher z-index than plots, so they are placed on top of them. A slight increase of a line's width can also go a long way in making it stand out.

If you want a special plot to stand out, you can also give it more importance by using multiple plots for the same line. These are examples where we modulate the successive width and transparency of plots to achieve this:



```
//@version=5
indicator("Calculated colors", "", true)
float ma = ta.sma (close, 20)
float maHeight = ta.percentrank (ma, 100)
float transparency = math.min(80, 100 - maHeight)
plot(ma, "MA1", color.rgb(156, 39, 176, transparency), 2)
plot(close, "Close", color.blue)
```

The color used in the first plot is a calculated color because its transparency can only be known at runtime. It is
calculated using the relative position of the moving average in relation to its past 100 values. The greater percentage
of past values are below the current value, the higher the 0-100 value of `maHeight` will be. Since we want the color
to be the darkest when `maHeight` is 100, we subtract 100 from it to obtain the zero transparency then. We also cap
the calculated `transparency` value to a maximum of 80 so that it always remains visible.

Because that calculated color is used in our script, the "Settings/Style" tab will not show any color widgets:

The solution to enable script users to control the colors used is to supply them with custom inputs, as we do here:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Calculated colors", "", true)
color maInput = input.color(color.purple, "MA")
color closeInput = input.color(color.blue, "Close")
float ma = ta.sma (close, 20)
float maHeight = ta.percentrank (ma, 100)
float transparency = math.min(80, 100 - maHeight)
// This plot uses a calculated color.
plot(ma, "MA1", color.new(maInput, transparency), 2)
// This plot does not use a calculated color.
plot(close, "Close", closeInput)
```

Notice how our script's "Settings" now show an "Inputs” tab, where we have created two color inputs. The first one
uses color.purple as its default value. Whether the script user changes that color or not, it will then be used in a
color.new() call to generate a calculated transparency in the plot() call. The second input uses as its default the
built-in color.blue color we previously used in the plot() call, and simply use it as is in the second plot() call.

User Manual • Concepts. Fills

# Fills

*   Introduction
*   `plot()` and `hline()` fills
*   Line fills

## Introduction

There are two different mechanisms dedicated to filling the space between Pine visuals:

*   The `fill()` function lets you color the background between either two plots plotted using `plot()` or two horizontal lines plotted using `hline()`.
*   The `linefill.new()` function fills the space between lines created with `line.new()`.

## `plot()` and `hline()` fills

The `fill()` function has two signatures:

```
fill(plot1, plot2, color, title, editable, show_last, fillgaps) → void
fill (hlinel, hline2, color, title, editable, fillgaps) → void
```

The arguments used for the `plot1`, `plot2`, `hline1` and `hline2` parameters must be the IDs returned by the `plot()` and `hline()` calls. The `fill()` function is the only built-in function where these IDs are used.

See in this first example how the IDs returned by the `plot()` and `hline()` calls are captured in the `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `h1`, `h2`, `h3` and `h4` variables for reuse as `fill()` arguments:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Example 1")
p1 = plot(math.sin(high))
p2 = plot(math.cos(low))
p3 = plot(math.sin(close))
fill(p1, p3, color.new(color.red, 90))
fill(p2, p3, color.new(color.blue, 90))
h1 = hline(0)
h2 = hline(1.0)
h3 = hline(0.5)
h4 = hline(1.5)
fill(h1, h2, color.new(color.yellow, 90))
fill(h3, h4, color.new(color.lime, 90))
```

Because `fill()` requires two IDs from the same function, we sometimes need to use a `plot()` call where we would have otherwise used an `hline()` call, as in this example:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Example 2")
src = close
ma = ta.sma(src, 10)
osc = 100 * (ma - src) / ma
oscPlotID = plot(osc)
// An `hline()` would not work here because two `plot()` calls are needed.
zeroPlotID = plot(0, "Zero", color.silver, 1, plot.style_circles)
fill(oscPlotID, zeroPlotID, color.new(color.blue, 90))
```

Because a "series color” can be used as an argument for the color parameter in fill(), you can use constants like
color.red or #FF001A, as well as expressions calculating the color on each bar, as in this example:



```
//@version=5
indicator("Example 3", "", true)
line1 = ta.sma(close, 5)
line2 = ta.sma(close, 20)
p1PlotID = plot(line1)
p2PlotID = plot(line2)
fill(p1PlotID, p2PlotID, line1 > line2 ? color.new(color.green, 90) : color.new(color...
```

## Line fills

Linefills are objects that allow you to fill the space between two line drawings created via the line.new() function. A
linefill object is displayed on the chart when the linefill.new() function is called. The function has the following
signature:

`linefill.new(line1, line2, color)  <- series linefill`

The `line1` and `line2` arguments are the line IDs of the two lines to fill between. The `color` argument is the
color of the fill. Any two-line pair can only have one linefill between them, so successive calls to linefill.new() on the
same pair of lines will replace the previous linefill with a new one. The function returns the ID of the `linefill`
object it created, which can be saved in a variable for use in linefill.set_color() call that will change the color of an
existing linefill.

The behavior of linefills is dependent on the lines they are attached to. Linefills cannot be moved directly; their coordinates follow those of the lines they are tied to. If both lines extend in the same direction, the linefill will also extend.

Note that for line extensions to work correctly, a line's `x1` coordinate must be less than its `x2` coordinate. If a line's `x1` argument is greater than its `x2` argument and `extend.left` is used, the line will actually extend to the right because `x2` is assumed to be the rightmost x coordinate.

In the example below, our indicator draws two lines connecting the last two high and low pivot points of the chart. We extend the lines to the right to project the short-term movement of the chart, and fill the space between them to enhance the visibility of the channel the lines create:

# Introduction

Inputs allow scripts to receive values that users can change. Using them for key values will make your scripts more
adaptable to user preferences.

The following script plots a 20-period simple moving average (SMA) using `ta.sma(close, 20)`. While it is simple to
write, it is not very flexible because that specific MA is all it will ever plot:

```
//@version=5
indicator("MA", "", true)
plot(ta.sma(close, 20))
```

If instead we write our script this way, it becomes much more flexible because its users will be able to select the
source and the length they want to use for the MA's calculation:

```
//@version=5
indicator("MA", "", true)
sourceInput = input(close, "Source")
lengthInput = input(20, "Length")
plot(ta.sma (sourceInput, lengthInput))
```

Inputs can only be accessed when a script is running on the chart. Script users access them through the script's
"Settings" dialog box, which can be reached by either:
• Double-clicking on the name of an on-chart indicator
• Right-clicking on the script's name and choosing the "Settings" item from the dropdown menu
• Choosing the "Settings" item from the "More" menu icon (three dots) that appears when one hovers over the
indicator's name on the chart
• Double-clicking on the indicator's name from the Data Window (fourth icon down to the right of the chart)

The "Settings" dialog box always contains the "Style" and "Visibility” tabs, which allow users to specify their
preferences about the script's visuals and the chart timeframes where it should be visible.

When a script contains calls to `input.*()` functions, an "Inputs" tab appears in the "Settings" dialog box.

In the flow of a script's execution, inputs are processed when the script is already on a chart and a user changes
values in the "Inputs” tab. The changes trigger a re-execution of the script on all the chart bars, so when a user
changes an input value, your script recalculates using that new value.

## Input functions

The following input functions are available:
• `input()`
• `input.int()`
• `input.float()`
• `input.bool()`
• `input.color()`
• `input.string()`
• `input.timeframe()`
• `input.symbol()`
• `input.price()`
• `input.source()`
• `input.session()`
• `input.time()`

A specific input widget is created in the "Inputs" tab to accept each type of input. Unless otherwise specified in the
`input.*()` call, each input appears on a new line of the "Inputs" tab, in the order the `input.* ()` calls appear in
the script.

Our Style guide recommends placing `input.*()` calls at the beginning of the script.

## Input function parameters

Input function definitions typically contain many parameters, which allow you to control the default value of inputs, their limits, and their organization in the "Inputs" tab.

An `input.*()` call being just another function call in Pine Script™, its result can be combined with arithmetic, comparison, logical or ternary operators to form an expression to be assigned to the variable. Here, we compare the result of our call to `input.string()` to the string "On". The expression's result is then stored in the `plotDisplayInput` variable. Since that variable holds a `true` or `false` value, it is a of "input bool" type:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Input in an expression`", "", true)
bool plotDisplayInput = input.string("On", "Plot Display", options = ["On", "Off"])
plot(plotDisplayInput ? close : na)
```

All values returned by `input.*()` functions except “source” ones are of the "input" form (see the section on forms for more information).

# Input function parameters

The parameters common to all input functions are: `defval`, `title`, `tooltip`, `inline` and `group`. Some parameters are used by the other input functions: `options`, `minval`, `maxval`, `step` and `confirm`.

All these parameters expect arguments of "const” form (except if it's an input used for a "source", which returns a "series float" result). This means they must be known at compile time and cannot change during the script's execution. Because the result of `input.*()` function is always of "input" or "series" form, it follows that the result of one `input.*()` function call cannot be used as an argument in a subsequent `input.*()` call because the "input" form is stronger than the "const" form.

Let's go over each parameter:

*   `defval` is the first parameter of all input functions. It is the default value that will appear in the input widget. It requires an argument of the type of input value the function is used for.
*   `title` requires a "const string" argument. It is the field's label.
*   `tooltip` requires a "const string" argument. When the parameter is used, a question mark icon will appear to the right of the field. When users hover over it, the tooltip's text will appear. Note that if multiple input fields are grouped on one line using `inline`, the tooltip will always appear to the right of the rightmost field, and display the text of the last `tooltip` argument used in the line. Newlines (`\n`) are supported in the argument string.
*   `inline` requires a "const string" argument. Using the same argument for the parameter in multiple `input.*()` calls will group their input widgets on the same line. There is a limit to the width the "Inputs" tab will expand, so a limited quantity of input fields can be fitted on one line. Using one `input.*()` call with a unique argument for `inline` has the effect of bringing the input field left, immediately after the label, foregoing the default left-alignment of all input fields used when no `inline` argument is used.
*   `group` requires a “const string" argument. It used to group any number of inputs in the same section. The string used as the `group` argument becomes the section's heading. All `input.*()` calls to be grouped together must use the same string for their `group` argument.
*   `options` requires a comma-separated list of elements enclosed in square brackets (e.g., `["ON", "OFF"]`). It is used to create a dropdown menu offering the list's elements in the form of menu selections. Only one menu item can be selected. When an `options` list is used, the `defval` value must be one of the list's elements. When `options` is used in input functions allowing `minval`, `maxval` or `step`, those parameters cannot be used simultaneously.
*   `minval` requires a "const int/float" argument, depending on the type of the `defval` value. It is the minimum valid value for the input field.
*   `maxval` requires a "const int/float" argument, depending on the type of the `defval` value. It is the maximum valid value for the input field.
• `step` is the increment by which the field's value will move when the widget's up/down arrows are used.
• `confirm` requires a “const bool” (`true` or `false`) argument. This parameter affect the behavior of the script when it is added to a chart. `input.*()` calls using `confirm = true` will cause the “Settings/Inputs" tab to popup when the script is added to the chart. `confirm` is useful to ensure that users configure a particular field.

The `minval`, `maxval` and `step` parameters are only present in the signature of the `input.int()` and `input.float()` functions.

## Input types

The next sections explain what each input function does. As we proceed, we will explore the different ways you can use input functions and organize their display.

## Simple input

`input()` is a simple, generic function that supports the fundamental Pine Script™ types: "int", "float", "bool", "color" and "string". It also supports "source" inputs, which are price-related values such as `close`, `hl2`, `hlc3`, and `hlcc4`, or which can be used to receive the output value of another script.

Its signature is:

```
input(defval, title, tooltip, inline, group) → input int/float/bool/color/string | seri
```

The function automatically detects the type of input by analyzing the type of the `defval` argument used in the function call. This script shows all the supported types and the form-type returned by the function when used with `defval` arguments of different types:

```
//@version=5
indicator("`input()`", "", true)
a = input(1, "input int")
b = input(1.0, "input float")
c = input(true, "input bool")
d = input(color.orange, "input color")
e = input("1", "input string")
f = input(close, "series float")
plot(na)
```

## Integer input

Two signatures exist for the `input.int()` function; one when `options` is not used, the other when it is:

```
input.int(defval, title, minval, maxval, step, tooltip, inline, group, confirm) → input int
input.int(defval, title, options, tooltip, inline, group, confirm)
```

This call uses the `options` parameter to propose a pre-defined list of lengths for the MA:

```
//@version=5
indicator("MA", "", true)
maLengthInput = input.int(10, options = [3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 50, 100, 200])
ma = ta.sma(close, maLengthInput)
plot(ma)
```

This one uses the `minval` parameter to limit the length:

```
//@version=5
indicator("MA", "", true)
maLengthInput = input.int(10, minval = 2)
ma = ta.sma(close, maLengthInput)
plot(ma)
```

The version with the `options` list uses a dropdown menu for its widget. When the `options` parameter is not used, a simple input widget is used to enter the value.



## Float input

Two signatures exist for the `input.float()` function; one when `options` is not used, the other when it is:

```
input.int(defval, title, minval, maxval, step, tooltip, inline, group, confirm)
input.int(defval, title, options, tooltip, inline, group, confirm) input int
```

Here, we use a "float" input for the factor used to multiple the standard deviation, to calculate Bollinger Bands:

```
//@version=5
indicator("MA", "", true)
maLengthInput = input.int(10, minval = 1)
bbFactorInput = input.float(1.5, minval = 0, step = 0.5)
ma = ta.sma(close, maLengthInput)
bbWidth = ta.stdev (ma, maLengthInput) * bbFactorInput
bbHi = ma + bbWidth
bbLo = ma - bbWidth
plot(ma)
plot(bbHi, "BB Hi", color.gray)
plot(bbLo, "BB Lo", color.gray)
```

The input widgets for floats are similar to the ones used for integer inputs.

![TradingView input widgets]

## Boolean input

Let's continue to develop our script further, this time by adding a boolean input to allow users to toggle the display of the BBs:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("MA", "", true)
maLengthInput = input.int(10, "MA length", minval = 1)
bbFactorInput = input.float(1.5, "BB factor", inline = "01", minval = 0, step = 0.5)
showBBInput = input.bool(true, "Show BB", inline = "01")
ma = ta.sma(close, maLengthInput)
bbWidth = ta.stdev (ma, maLengthInput) * bbFactorInput
bbHi = ma + bbWidth
bbLo = ma - bbWidth
plot(ma, "MA", color.aqua)
plot(showBBInput ? bbHi : na, "BB Hi", color.gray)
plot(showBBInput ? bbLo: na, "BB Lo", color.gray)
```

Note that:

*   We have added an input using `input.bool()` to set the value of `showBBInput`.
*   We use the `inline` parameter in that input and in the one for `bbFactorInput` to bring them on the same line. We use `"01"` for its argument in both cases. That is how the Pine Script™ compiler recognizes that they belong on the same line. The particular string used as an argument is unimportant and does not appear anywhere in the "Inputs” tab; it is only used to identify which inputs go on the same line.
*   We have vertically aligned the `title` arguments of our `input.*()` calls to make them easier to read.
• We use the `showBBInput` variable in our two `plot()` calls to plot conditionally. When the user unchecks the checkbox of the `showBBInput` input, the variable's value becomes `false`. When that happens, our `plot()` calls plot the `na` value, which displays nothing. We use `true` as the default value of the input, so the BBs plot by default.
• Because we use the `inline` parameter for the `bbFactorInput` variable, its input field in the "Inputs" tab does not align vertically with that of `maLengthInput`, which doesn't use `inline`.

` levels
*   Fills between levels

`hline()` levels

Levels are lines plotted using the `hline()` function. It is designed to plot horizontal levels using a single color, i.e., it does not change on different bars. See the Levels section of the page on `plot()` for alternative ways to plot levels when `hline()` won't do what you need.

The function has the following signature:

`hline (price, title, color, linestyle, linewidth, editable) => line`

`hline()` has a few constraints when compared to `plot()`:

*   Since the function's objective is to plot horizontal lines, its `price` parameter requires an "input int/float" argument, which means that "series float" values such as `close` or dynamically-calculated values cannot be used.
*   Its `color` parameter requires an "input int" argument, which precludes the use of dynamic colors, i.e., colors calculated on each bar or "series color" values.
*   Three different line styles are supported through the `linestyle` parameter: `hline.style_solid`, `hline.style_dotted` and `hline.style_dashed`.

Let's see `hline()` in action in the "True Strength Index" indicator:

```
//@version=5
indicator("TSI")
myTSI = 100 * ta.tsi (close, 25, 13)

hline (50, "+50", color.lime)
hline (25, "+25", color.green)
hline(0, "Zero", color.gray, linestyle = hline.style_dotted)
hline(-25, "-25", color.maroon)
hline (-50, "-50", color.red)
plot(myTSI)
```

Note that:

*   We display 5 levels, each of a different color.
*   We use a different line style for the zero centerline.
*   We choose colors that will work well on both light and dark themes.
*   The usual range for the indicator's values is +100 to -100. Since the `ta.tsi()` built-in returns values in the +1 to -1 range, we make the adjustment in our code.

Fills between levels

The space between two levels plotted with `hline()` can be colored using `fill()`. Keep in mind that both plots must have been plotted with `hline()`.

Let's put some background colors in our TSI indicator:

```
//@version=5
indicator("TSI")
myTSI = 100 * ta.tsi(close, 25, 13)

plus50Hline = hline(50, "+50", color.lime)
plus25Hline = hline(25, "+25", color.green)
zeroHline = hline(0, "Zero", color.gray, linestyle = hline.style_dotted)
minus25Hline = hline(-25, "-25", color.maroon)
minus50Hline = hline(-50, "-50", color.red)

// Function returns a color in a light shade for use as a background.
fillColor(color col) =>
    color.new(col, 90)

fill(plus50Hline, plus25Hline, fillColor(color.lime))
fill(plus25Hline, zeroHline, fillColor(color.teal))
fill(zeroHline, minus25Hline, fillColor(color.maroon))
fill(minus25Hline, minus50Hline, fillColor(color.red))

plot(myTSI)
```

Note that:
*   We have now used the return value of our `hline()` function calls, which is of the `hline` special type. We use the `plus50Hline`, `plus25Hline`, `zeroHline`, `minus25Hline` and `minus50Hline` variables to store those "hline" IDs because we will need them in our `fill()` calls later.
*   To generate lighter color shades for the background colors, we declare a `fillColor()` function that accepts a color and returns its 90 transparency. We use calls to that function for the `color` arguments in our `fill()` calls.
*   We make our `fill()` calls for each of the four different fills we want, between four different pairs of levels.
*   We use `color.teal` in our second fill because it produces a green that fits the color scheme better than the `color.green` used for the 25 level.

Introduction

Pine Script™ libraries are publications containing functions that can be reused in Pine Script™ indicators, strategies, or in other libraries. They are useful to define frequently-used functions so their source code does not have to be included in every script where they are needed.

A library must be published (privately or publicly) before it can be used in another script. All libraries are published open-source. Public scripts can only use public libraries and they must be open-source. Private scripts or personal scripts saved in the Pine Script™ Editor can use public or private libraries. A library can use other libraries, or even previous versions of itself.

Library programmers should be familiar with Pine Script™'s typing nomenclature, scopes and user-defined functions. If you need to brush up on Pine Script™ forms and types, see the User Manual's page on the Type system. For more information on user-defined functions and scopes, see the User-defined functions page.

You can browse the library scripts published publicly by members in TradingView's Community Scripts.

Creating a library

A Pine Script™ library is a special kind of script that begins with the `library()` declaration statement, rather than `indicator()` or `strategy()`. A library contains exportable function definitions, which constitute the only visible part of the library when it is used by another script. Libraries can also use other Pine Script™ code in their global scope, like a normal indicator. This code will typically serve to demonstrate how to use the library's functions.

A library script has the following structure, where one or more exportable functions must be defined:

```
//@version=5
// @description <library_description>
library(title, overlay)
<script_code>
// @function <function_description>
// @param <parameter> <parameter_description>
// @returns <return_value_description>
export <function_name>((simple/series] <parameter_type> <parameter_name> [= <default_va
<function code>
<script_code>
```

Note that:

*   The `// @description`, `// @function`, `// @param` and `// @returns` compiler annotations are
    optional but we highly recommend you use them. They serve a double purpose: document the library's code and
    populate the default library description which authors can use when publishing the library.
*   The `export` keyword is mandatory.
*   `<parameter_type>` is mandatory, contrary to user-defined function parameter definitions in indicators or
    strategies, which are typeless.
*   `<script_code>` can be any code you would normally use in an indicator, including inputs or plots.

This is an example library:

```
//@version=5
// @description Provides functions calculating the all-time high/low of values.
library("AllTimeHighLow", true)

// @function Calculates the all-time high of a series.
// @param val Series to use (`high` is used if no argument is supplied).
// @returns The all-time high for the series.
export hi(float val = high) =>
    var float ath = val
    ath := math.max(ath, val)

// @function Calculates the all-time low of a series.
// @param val Series to use (`low` is used if no argument is supplied).
// @returns The all-time low for the series.
export lo(float val = low) =>
    var float atl = val
    atl := math.min(atl, val)

plot(hi())
plot(lo())
```

## Library functions

Function definitions in libraries are slightly different than those of user-defined functions in indicators and strategies.
There are constraints as to what can be included in the body of library functions.

In library function signatures (their first line):

*   The `export` keyword is mandatory.
*   The type of argument expected for each parameter must be explicitly mentioned.
*   A `simple` or `series` form modifier can restrict the allowable forms of arguments (the next section explains their use).

These are the constraints imposed on library functions:

*   They cannot use variables from the library's global scope unless they are of "const" form. This means you cannot use global variables initialized from script inputs, for example, or globally declared arrays.
*   `request.*()` calls are not allowed.
*   `input.*()` calls are not allowed.
*   `plot()`, `fill()` and `bgcolor()` calls are not allowed.

Library functions always return a result that is either of "simple" or "series” form. You cannot use them to calculate values where “const” or “input" forms are required, as is the case with some Pine Script™ built-in function arguments. For example, a library function cannot be used to calculate an argument for the `show_last` parameter in a `plot()` call, because an "input int" argument is required for `show_last`.

## Argument form control

The form of arguments supplied in calls to library functions is autodetected based on how the argument is used inside the function. If the argument can be used in "series” form, it is. If it cannot, an attempt is made with the "simple" type form. This explains why this code:

```
export myEma (int x) =>
ta.ema (close, x)
```

will work when called using `myCustomLibrary.myEma(20)`, even though `ta.ema()`'s `length` parameter requires a "simple int" argument. When the Pine Script™ compiler detects that a "series” length cannot be used with `ta.ema()`, it tries the "simple" form, which in this case is allowed.

While library functions cannot return results of "const" or "input" forms, they can be written to produce a result of "simple” form. This makes them useful in more contexts than functions returning a result of "series” form, because some Pine Script™ built-in functions do not allow "series" arguments. For example, `request.security()` requires a "simple string" for its `symbol` parameter. If we wrote a library function to assemble the argument to `symbol` in the following way, the function's result would not work because it is of "series” form:

```
export makeTickerid (string prefix, string ticker) =>
prefix + ":" + ticker
```

However, by restricting the form of its parameters to "simple", we could force the function to yield a "simple" result. We can achieve this by prefixing the parameters' type with the `simple` keyword:

```
export makeTickerid (simple string prefix, simple string ticker) =>
prefix + ":" + ticker
```

Note that for the function to return a "simple” result, no "series” values can be used in its calculation; otherwise the result will be of "series" form.

One can also use the `series` keyword to prefix the type of a library function parameter. However, because arguments are by default cast to the "series” form, using the `series` modifier is redundant; it exists more for completeness.

## User-defined types and objects

You can export user-defined types (UDTs) from libraries, and library functions can return objects.
To export a UDT, prefix its definition with the `export` keyword just as you would export a function:

```
//@version=5
library("Point")

export type point
```pine
int x
float y
bool isHi
bool wasBreached = false
```

A script importing that library and creating an object from its `point` UDT would look somewhat like this:

```
//@version=5
indicator("")
import userName/Point/1 as pt
newPoint = pt.point.new()
```

Note that:

*   This code won't compile because no "Point" library is published, and the script doesn't display anything.
*   `userName` would need to be replaced by the TradingView user name of the library's publisher.
*   We use the built-in `new()` method to create an object from the `point` UDT.
*   We prefix the reference to the library's `point` UDT with the `pt` alias defined in the `import` statement, just like we would when using a function from an imported library.

UDTs used in a library must be exported if any of its exported functions use a parameter or returns a result of that user-defined type.

When a library only uses a UDT internally, it does not have to be exported. The following library uses the `point` UDT internally, but only its `drawPivots()` function is exported, which does not use a parameter nor return a result of `point` type:

```
//@version=5
library("PivotLabels", true)
```pine
// We use this `point` UDT in the library, but it does NOT require exporting because:
//  1. The exported function's parameters do not use the UDT.
//  2. The exported function does not return a UDT result.
type point
    int x
    float y
    bool isHi
    bool wasBreached = false
```

```pine
fillPivotsArray(qtyLabels, leftLegs, rightLegs) =>
    // Create an array of the specified qty of pivots to maintain.
    var pivotsArray = array.new<point>(math.max(qtyLabels, 0))

    // Detect pivots.
    float pivotHi = ta.pivothigh(leftLegs, rightLegs)
    float pivotLo = ta.pivotlow(leftLegs, rightLegs)

    // Create a new `point` object when a pivot is found.
    point foundPoint = switch
        pivotHi => point.new(time[rightLegs], pivotHi, true)
        pivotLo => point.new(time[rightLegs], pivotLo, false)
        => na

    // Add new pivot info to the array and remove the oldest pivot.
    if not na(foundPoint)
        array.push(pivotsArray, foundPoint)
```

```pine
array.shift(pivotsArray)
array<point> result = pivotsArray

detectBreaches (pivotsArray) =>
// Detect breaches.
for [i, eachPoint] in pivotsArray
    if not na (eachPoint)
        if not eachPoint.wasBreached
            bool hiWasBreached = eachPoint.isHi and high [1] <= eachPoint.y and
            bool loWasBreached = not eachPoint.isHi and low [1] >= eachPoint.y and
            if hiWasBreached or loWasBreached
                // This pivot was breached; change its `wasBreached` field.
                point p = array.get(pivotsArray, i)
                p.wasBreached := true
                array.set(pivotsArray, i, p)

drawLabels (pivotsArray) =>
    for eachPoint in pivotsArray
        if not na (eachPoint)
            label.new(
              eachPoint.x,
              eachPoint.y,
              str.tostring(eachPoint.y, format.mintick),
              xloc.bar_time,
              color = eachPoint.wasBreached ? color.gray : eachPoint.isHi ? color.teal : color.gray,
              style = eachPoint.isHi ? label.style_label_down : label.style_label_up,
              textcolor = eachPoint.wasBreached ? color.silver : color.white)

// @function
// Displays a label for each of the last `qtyLabels` pivots.
// Colors high pivots in green, low pivots in red, and breached pivots
// @param qtyLabels (simple int) Quantity of last labels to display.

export drawPivots (int qtyLabels, int leftLegs, int rightLegs) =>
    // Gather pivots as they occur.
    pointsArray = fillPivotsArray (qtyLabels, leftLegs, rightLegs)

    // Mark breached pivots.

    // Draw labels once.
    if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
        drawLabels (pointsArray)

// Example use of the function.
drawPivots (20, 10, 5)
```

If the TradingView user published the above library, it could be used like this:

```
//@version=5
indicator("")
import TradingView/PivotLabels/1 as dpl
dpl.drawPivots (20, 10, 10)
```

Publishing a library

Before you or other Pine Script ™ programmers can reuse any library, it must be published. If you want to share your
library with all TradingViewers, publish it publicly. To use it privately, use a private publication. As with indicators or
strategies, the active chart when you publish a library will appear in both its widget (the small placeholder denoting
libraries in the TradingView scripts stream) and script page (the page users see when they click on the widget).
Private libraries can be used in public Protected or Invite-only scripts.
After adding our example library to the chart and setting up a clean chart showing our library plots the way we want
them, we use the Pine Editor's "Publish Script" button. The "Publish Library" window comes up:

Publish Library

Library title and description
All TimeHighLow

IBC

Library **"AllTimeHighLow"**
Provides functions calculating the all-time high/low of values.

**hi(val)** Calculates the all-time high of a series.
Parameters:
* **val**: Series to use ('high' is used if no argument is supplied).
Returns: The all-time high for the series.

**lo(val)** Calculates the all-time low of a series.
Parameters:
* **val**: Series to use (`low' is used if no argument is supplied).
Returns: The all-time low for the series.

Note that:

*   We leave the library's title as is (the `title` argument in our `library()` declaration statement is used as the
    default). While you can change the publication's title, it is preferable to keep its default value because the
    `title` argument is used to reference imported libraries in the `import` statement. It makes life easier for
    library users when your publication's title matches the actual name of the library.
*   A default description is built from the compiler annotations we used in our library. We will publish the library
    wihout retouching it.
*   We chose to publish our library publicly, so it will be visible to all TradingViewers.
*   We do not have the possibility of selecting a visibility type other than “Open” because libraries are always open-
    source.
*   The list of categories for libraries is different than for indicators and strategies. We have selected the "Statistics
    and Metrics" category.
*   We have added some custom tags: "all-time", "high" and "low".

The intended users of public libraries being other Pine Script ™ programmers; the better you explain and document
your library's functions, the more chances others will use them. Providing examples demonstrating how to use your
library's functions in your publication's code will also help.

House Rules

Pine libraries are considered public domain code in our , which entails that, contrary
to open-source indicators and strategies, permission is not required from their author if you reuse their functions in
your open-source scripts. If you intend to reuse code from a Pine Script ™ library's functions in a public, closed-source
publication (protected or invite-only), explicit permission for reuse in that form is required from its author.

With the provision that public Pine Script™ libraries are considered to be “public domain", our House Rules on the
reuse of open-source Pine scripts apply to them:

*   You must credit the author in your publication's description. It is also good form to credit in open-source
    comments.
*   You must make significant improvements to the original code base, and it must account for a small proportion of
    your script.
*   Your script must also be published open-source, unless explicit permission to that effect was granted by the
    original author, or unless the reused code is considered public domain AND it constitutes an insignificant part of
    your codebase.

## Using a library

Using a library from another script (which can be an indicator, a strategy or another library), is done through the
`import` statement:

```
import <username>/<libraryName>/<libraryVersion> [as <alias>]
```

where:

*   The `<username>/<libraryName>/<libraryVersion>` path will uniquely identify the library.
*   The `<libraryVersion>` must be specified explicitly. To ensure the reliability of scripts using libraries, there is no
    way to automatically use the latest version of a library. Every time a library update is published by its author,
    the library's version number increases. If you intend to use the latest version of the library, the `<libraryVersion>`
    value will require updating in the `import` statement.
*   The `as <alias>` part is optional. When used, it defines the namespace that will refer to the library's
    functions. For example, if you import a library using the `allTime` alias as we do in the example below, you will
    refer to that library's functions as `allTime.<function_name>()`. When no alias is defined, the library's
    name becomes its namespace.

To use the library we published in the previous section, our next script will require an `import` statement:

```
import PineCoders/AllTimeHighLow/1 as allTime
```

As you type the user name of the library's author, you can use the Editor's `ctrl` + `space` / `cmd` + `space` "Auto-
complete" command to display a popup providing selections that match the available libraries:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Using AllTimeHighLow library")
import PineCoders
import PineCoders/AllTimeHighLow/1 // Provides functions calculating the all-tim
```

This is an indicator that reuses our library:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Using AllTimeHighLow library", "", true)
import PineCoders/AllTimeHighLow/1 as allTime
plot(allTime.hi())
plot(allTime.lo())
plot(allTime.hi(close))
```

Note that:

*   We have chosen to use the "allTime” alias for the library's instance in our script. When typing that alias in the Editor, a popup will appear to help you select the particular function you want to use from the library.
*   We use the library's `hi()` and `lo()` functions without an argument, so the default `high` and `low` built-in variables will be used for their series, respectively.
*   We use a second call to `allTime.hi()`, but this time using `close` as its argument, to plot the highest `close` in the chart's history.

## Introduction

Lines and boxes are only available in v4 and higher versions of Pine Script™. They are useful to draw support and resistance levels, trend lines, price ranges. Multiple small line segments are also useful to draw complex geometric forms.

The flexibility lines and boxes allow in their positioning mechanism makes them particularly well-suited to drawing objects at points in the past that are detected a variable number of bars after the fact.

Lines and boxes are objects, like labels and tables. Like them, they are referred to using an ID, which acts like a pointer. Line IDs are of “line” type, and box IDs are of "box" type. As with other Pine Script™ objects, lines and box IDs are "time series" and all the functions used to manage them accept "series" arguments, which makes them very flexible.

Note
On TradingView charts, a complete set of Drawing Tools allows users to create and modify drawings using mouse
actions. While they may sometimes look similar to drawing objects created with Pine Script ™ code, they are
unrelated entities. Lines and boxes created using Pine Script ™ code cannot be modified with mouse actions, and
hand-drawn drawings from the chart user interface are not visible from Pine scripts.

Lines can be horizontal or at an angle, while boxes are always rectangular. Both share many common characteristics:
* They can start and end from any point on the chart, including the future.
* The functions used to manage them can be placed in conditional or loop structures, making it easier to control their behavior.
* They can be extended to infinity, left or right of their anchoring coordinates.
* Their attributes can be changed during the script's execution.
* The x coordinates used to position them can be expressed as a bar index or a time value.
* In the x coordinate, they start and stop on the middle of the bar.
* Different pre-defined styles can be used for line patterns and end points, and box borders.
* A maximum of 500 of each can be drawn on the chart at any given time. The default is ~50, but you can use the `max_lines_count` and `max_boxes_count` parameters in your `indicator()` or `strategy()` declaration statement to specify up to 500. Lines and boxes, like labels, are managed using a garbage collection mechanism which deletes the oldest ones on the chart, such that only the most recently displayed are visible.

This script draws both lines and boxes:

```markdown
//@version=5
`indicator`("Opening bar's range", "", true)
`string` `tfInput` = `input`.`timeframe`("D", "Timeframe")
// Initialize variables on bar zero only, so they preserve their values across bars.
`var` `hi` = `float`(`na`)
`var` `lo` = `float`(`na`)
`var` `line` `hiLine` = `na`
`var` `line` `loLine` = `na`
`var` `box` `hiLoBox` = `na`
// Detect changes in timeframe.
`bool` `newTF` = `ta`.`change`(`time`(`tfInput`))
`if` `newTF`
    // New bar in higher timeframe; reset values and create new lines and box.
    `hi` := `high`
    `lo` := `low`
    `hiLine` := `line`.`new`(`bar_index` - 1, `hi`, `bar_index`, `hi`, `color` = `color`.`green`, `width` = 2)
    `loLine` := `line`.`new`(`bar_index` - 1, `lo`, `bar_index`, `lo`, `color` = `color`.`red`, `width` = 2)
    `hiLoBox` := `box`.`new`(`bar_index` - 1, `hi`, `bar_index`, `lo`, `border_color` = `na`, `bgcolor` = `color`.`new`(`color`.`green`, 90))
    `int`(`na`)
`else`
    // On other bars, extend the right coordinate of lines and box.
    `line`.`set_x2`(`hiLine`, `bar_index`)
    `line`.`set_x2`(`loLine`, `bar_index`)
    `box`.`set_right`(`hiLoBox`, `bar_index`)
    // Change the color of the boxes' background depending on whether high/low is higher.
    `boxColor` = `high` > `hi` ? `color`.`green` : `low` < `lo` ? `color`.`red` : `color`.`silver`
    `box`.`set_bgcolor`(`hiLoBox`, `color`.`new`(`boxColor`, 50))
    `int`(`na`)
```

Note that:

*   We are detecting the first bar of a user-defined higher timeframe and saving its `high` and `low` values.
*   We draw the `hi` and `low` levels using one line for each.
*   We fill the space in between with a box.
*   Every time we create two new lines and a box, we save their ID in variables `hiLine`, `loLine` and `hiLoBox`, which we then use in the calls to the setter functions to prolong these objects as new bars come in during the higher timeframe.
*   We change the color of the boxes' background (`boxColor`) using the position of the bar's `high` and `low` with relative to the opening bar's same values. This entails that our script is repainting, as the boxes' color on past bars will change, depending on the current bar's values.
*   We artificially make the return type of both branches of our `if` structure `int(na)` so the compiler doesn't complain about them not returning the same type. This occurs because `box.new()` in the first branch returns a result of type "box", while `box.set_bgcolor()` in the second branch returns type "void". See the Matching local block type requiremement section for more information.

Lines

Lines are managed using built-in functions in the `line` namespace. They include:

*   `line.new()` to create them.
*   `line.get_*()` functions to read the properties of an existing line.
*   `line.set_*()` functions to modify the properties of an line.
*   `line.copy()` to clone them.
*   `line.delete()` to delete them.
*   The `line.all` array which always contains the IDs of all the visible lines on the chart. The array's size will depend on the maximum line count for your script and how many of those you have drawn. `aray.size(line.all)` will return the array's size.

# Creating lines

The `line.new()` function creates a new line. It has the following signature:

```
line.new(x1, y1, x2, y2, xloc, extend, color, style, width) ← series line
```

Lines are positioned on the chart according to x (bars) and y (price) coordinates. Five parameters affect this behavior: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` and `xloc`:

`x1` and `x2`

They are the x coordinates of the line's start and end points. They are either a bar index or a time value, as determined by the argument used for `xloc`. When a bar index is used, the value can be offset in the past (maximum of 5000 bars) or in the future (maximum of 500 bars). Past or future offsets can also be calculated when using time values. The `x1` and `x2` values of an existing line can be modified using `line.set_x1()`, `line.set_x2()`, `line.set_xy1()` or `line.set_xy2()`.

`xloc`

Is either `xloc.bar_index` (the default) or `xloc.bar_time`. It determines which type of argument must be used with `x1` and `x2`. With `xloc.bar_index`, `x1` and `x2` must be absolute bar indices. With `xloc.bar_time`, `x1` and `x2` must be a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds corresponding to the `time` value of a bar's `open`. The `xloc` value of an existing line can be modified using `line.set_xloc()`.

`y1` and `y2`

They are the y coordinates of the line's start and end points. While they are called price levels, they must be of values that make sense in the script's visual space. For an RSI indicator, they would typically be between 0 and 100, for example. When an indicator is running as an overlay, then the price scale will usually be that of the chart's symbol. The `y1` and `y2` values of an existing line can be modified using `line.set_y1()`, `line.set_y2()`, `line.set_xy1()` or `line.set_xy2()`.

The remaining four parameters in `line.new()` control the visual appearance of lines:

`extend`

Determines if the line is extended past its coordinates. It can be `extend.none`, `extend.left`, `extend.right` or `extend.both`.

`color`

Is the line's color.

`style`

Is the style of line. See this page's  section.

`width`

Determines the width of the line in pixels.

This is how you can create lines in their simplest form. We connect the preceding bar's `high` to the current bar's `low`:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
line.new(bar_index - 1, high[1], bar_index, low, width = 3)
```

Note that:
* We use a different x1 and x2 value: `bar_index - 1` and `bar_index`. This is necessary, otherwise no line would be created.
* We make the width of our line 3 pixels using `width = 3`.
* No logic controls our `line.new()` call, so lines are created on every bar.
* Only approximately the last 50 lines are shown because that is the default value for the `max_lines_count` parameter in `indicator()`, which we haven't specified.
* Lines persist on bars until your script deletes them using `line.delete()`, or garbage collection removes them.

In this next example, we use lines to create probable travel paths for price. We draw a user-selected quantity of lines from the previous bar's center point between its `close` and `open` values. The lines project one bar after the current bar, after having been distributed along the `close` and `open` range of the current bar:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Price path projection", "PPP", true, max_lines_count = 100)
qtyOfLinesInput = input.int(10, minval = 1)

y2Increment = (close - open) / qtyOfLinesInput
// Starting point of the fan in y.
lineY1 = math.avg(close [1], open [1])
// Loop creating the fan of lines on each bar.
for i = 0 to qtyOfLinesInput
    // End point in y if line stopped at current bar.
    lineY2 = open + (y2Increment * i)
    // Extrapolate necessary y position to the next bar because we extend lines one bar
    lineY2 := lineY2 + (lineY2 - lineY1)
    lineColor = lineY2 > lineYl? color.lime : color.fuchsia
    line.new(bar_index - 1, lineYl, bar_index + 1, lineY2, color = lineColor)
```

Note that:

*   We are creating a set of lines from within a `for` structure.
*   We use the default `xloc = xloc.bar_index`, so our `x1` and `x2` values are bar indices.
*   We want to start lines on the previous bar, so we use `bar_index - 1` for `x1` and `bar_index + 1` for `x2`.
*   We use a "series color" value (its value can change in any of the loop's iterations) for the line's color. When the line is going up we make it lime; if not we make it fuchsia.
*   The script will repaint in realtime because it is using the `close` and `open` values of the realtime bar to calculate line projections. Once the realtime bar closes, the lines drawn on elapsed realtime bars will no longer update.
*   We use `max_lines_count = 100` in our `indicator()` call to preserve the last 100 lines.

## Modifying lines

The setter functions allowing you to change a line's properties are:

*   `line.set_x1()`
*   `line.set_y1()`
*   `line.set_xy1()`
*   `line.set_x2()`
*   `line.set_y2()`
*   `line.set_xy2()`
*   `line.set_xloc()`
*   `line.set_extend()`
*   `line.set_color()`
*   `line.set_style()`
*   `line.set_width()`

They all have a similar signature. The one for `line.set_color()` is:

```pine
line.set_color(id, color) => void
```

where:

*   `id` is the ID of the line whose property is to be modified.
*   The next parameter is the property of the line to modify. It depends on the setter function used. `line.set_xy1()` and `line.set_xy2()` change two properties, so they have two such parameters.

In the next example we display a line showing the highest `high` value in the last `lookbackInput` bars. We will be using setter functions to modify an existing line:

```pine
//@version=5
MAX BARS BACK = 500
indicator("Last high", "", true, max bars back = MAX BARS BACK)
repaintInput = input.bool(false, "Position bars in the past")
lookbackInput = input.int(50, minval = 1, maxval = MAX BARS BACK)

// Keep track of highest `high` and detect when it changes.
hi = ta.highest(lookbackInput)
newHi = ta.change (hi)

// Find the offset to the highest `high` in last 50 bars. Change it's sign so it is pos
highestBarOffset = ta.highestbars (lookbackInput)
// Create label on bar zero only.
var lbl = label.new(na, na, "", color = color(na), style = label.style_label_left)
var lin = line.new(na, na, na, na, xloc = xloc.bar_time, style = line.style_arrow_right)
// When a new high is found, move the label there and update its text and tooltip.
if newHi
    // Build line.
    lineX1 = time [highestBarOffset + 1]
    // Get the `high` value at that offset. Note that `highest(50)` would be equivalent
    // but it would require evaluation on every bar, prior to entry into this `if` stru
    lineY = high [highestBarOffset]
    // Determine line's starting point with user setting to plot in past or not.
    line.set_xy1(lin, repaintInput ? lineX1 : time [1], lineY)
    line.set_xy2(lin, repaintInput ? lineX1 : time, lineY)
    // Reposition label and display new high's value.
    label.set_xy(lbl, bar_index, lineY)
    label.set_text(lbl, str.tostring (lineY, format.mintick))
else
    // Update line's right end point and label to current bar's.
    line.set_x2(lin, time)
    label.set_x(lbl, bar_index)

// Show a blue dot when a new high is found.
plotchar (newHi, "newHighFound", ".", location.top, size = size.tiny)
```

Note that:

*   We plot the line starting on the bar preceding the point where the new high is found. We draw the line from the preceding bar so that we see a one bar line when a new high is found.
*   We only start the line in the past, from the actual highest point, when the user explicitly chooses to do so through the script's inputs. This gives the user control over the repainting behavior of the script. It also avoids

• misleading traders into thinking that our script is prescient and can know in advance if a high point will still be the high point in the lookback period n bars later.
• We manage the historical buffer to avoid runtime errors when referring to bars too far away in the past. We do two things for this: we use the `max_bars_back` parameter in our `indicator()` call, and we cap the input for `lookbackInput` using `maxval` in our `input.int()` call. Rather than use the `500` literal in two places, we create a `MAX_BARS_BACK` constant for it.
• We create our line and label on the first bar only, using `var`. From that point on, we only need to update their properties, so we are moving the same line and label along, resetting their position and the label's text when a new high is found, and then only updating their x coordinates as new bars come in. We use the `line.set_xy1()` and `line.set_xy1()` functions when we find a new high, and `line.set_x2()` on other bars, to extend the line.
• We use time values for `x1` and `x2` because our `line.new()` call specifies `xloc = xloc.bar_time`.
• We use `style = line.style_arrow_right` in our `line.new()` call to display a right arrow line style.
• Even though our label's background is not visible, we use `style = label.style_label_left` in our `label.new()` call so that the price value is positioned to the right of the chart's last bar.
• To better visualize on which bars a new high is found, we plot a blue dot using `plotchar()`. Note that this does not necessarily entail the bar where it appears is the new highest value. While this may happen, a new highest value can also be calculated because a long-standing high has dropped off from the lookback length and been replaced by another high that may not be on the bar where the blue dot appears.
• Our chart cursor points to the bar with the highest value in the last 50 bars.
• When the user does not choose to plot in the past, our script does not repaint.

## Line styles

Various styles can be applied to lines with either the `line.new()` or `line.set_style()` functions:

| Argument           | Line      | Argument                | Line      |
| ------------------ | --------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| `line.style_solid`   | ![line.style_solid][]  | `line.style_arrow_left`  | ![line.style_arrow_left][]  |
| `line.style_dotted`  | ![line.style_dotted][] | `line.style_arrow_right` | ![line.style_arrow_right][] |
| `line.style_dashed`  | ![line.style_dashed][] | `line.style_arrow_both`  | ![line.style_arrow_both][]  |

## Getting line properties

The following getter functions are available for lines:
• `line.get_price()`
• `line.get_x1()`
• `line.get_y1()`
• `line.get_x2()`
• `line.get_y2()`

The signature for `line.get_price()` is:

```
line.get_price(id, x) => series float
```

where:
• `id` is the line whose `x1` value is to be retrieved
• `x` is the bar index of the point on the line whose y coordinate is to be returned.

The last four functions all have a similar signature. The one for `line.get_x1()` is:

```
line.get_x1(id) ← series int
```

where `id` is the ID of the line whose `x1` value is to be retrieved.

## Cloning lines

The `line.copy()` function is used to clone lines. Its syntax is:

`line.copy(id) → void`

## Deleting lines

The `line.delete()` function is used to delete lines. Its syntax is:

`line.delete(id) → void`

To keep only a user-defined quantity of lines on the chart, one could use code like this, where we are dawing a level every time RSI rises/falls for a user-defined quantity of consecutive bars:

```pine
//@version=5
int MAX_LINES_COUNT = 500
indicator("RSI levels", max_lines_count = MAX_LINES_COUNT)
int linesToKeepInput = input.int(10, minval = 1, maxval = MAX_LINES_COUNT)
int sensitivityInput = input.int(5, minval = 1)
float myRSI = ta.rsi(close, 20)
bool myRSIRises = ta.rising(myRSI, sensitivityInput)
bool myRSIFalls = ta.falling(myRSI, sensitivityInput)
if myRSIRises or myRSIFalls
    color lineColor = myRSIRises ? color.new(color.green, 70) : color.new(color.red, 70)
    line.new(bar_index, myRSI, bar_index + 1, myRSI, color = lineColor, width = 2)
    // Once the new line is created, delete the oldest one if we have too many.
    if array.size(line.all) > linesToKeepInput
        line.delete(array.get(line.all, 0))
    int(na)
else
    // Extend all visible lines.
    int lineNo = 0
    while lineNo < array.size(line.all)
        line.set_x2(array.get(line.all, lineNo), bar_index)
        lineNo += 1
    int(na)
plot(myRSI)
hline(50)
// Plot markers to show where our triggering conditions are `true`.
plotchar(myRSIRises, "myRSIRises", "▲", location.top, color.green, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(myRSIFalls, "myRSIFalls", "▼", location.bottom, color.red, size = size.tiny)
```

Note that:
* We define a `MAX_LINES_COUNT` constant to hold the maximum quantity of lines a script can accommodate. We use that value to set the `max_lines_count` parameter's value in our `indicator()` call, and also as the `maxval` value in our `input.int()` call, to cap the user value.
* We use the `myRSIRises` and `myRSIFalls` variables to hold the states determining when we create a new level. After that, we delete the oldest line in the `line.all` built-in array that is automatically maintained by the Pine Script™ runtime and contains the ID of all the visible lines drawn by our script. We use the `array.get()` function to retrieve the array element at index zero (the oldest visible line ID). We then use `line.delete()` to delete the line referenced by that ID.
* Again, we need to artificially return `int(na)` in both local blocks of our `if` structure so the compiler doesn't not complain. See the  section for more information.
* This time, we mention the type of variables explicitly when we declare them, as in
`float myRSI = ta.rsi(close, 20)`. The declarations are functionally redundant, but they can help make your intention clear to readers of your code – you being the one who will read it the most frequently.

## Boxes

Boxes are managed using built-in functions in the `box` namespace. They include:
* `box.new()` to create them.
* `box.set()` functions to modify the properties of a box.
* `box.get()` functions to read some of the properties of an existing box.
* `box.copy()` to clone them.
* `box.delete()` to delete them.
* The `box.all` array which always contains the IDs of all the visible boxes on the chart. The array's size will depend on the maximum box count for your script and how many of those you have drawn.
aray.size(box.all) will return the array's size.

## Creating boxes

The `box.new()` function creates a new line. It has the following signature:

`box.new(left, top, right, bottom, border_color, border_width, border_style, extend, xlo`

Boxes are positioned on the chart according to x (bars) and y (price) coordinates. Five parameters affect this behavior: `left`, `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `xloc`:

**left and right**

They are the x coordinates of the line's start and end points. They are either a bar index or a time value, as determined by the argument used for `xloc`. When a bar index is used, the value can be offset in the past (maximum of 5000 bars) or in the future (maximum of 500 bars). Past or future offsets can also be calculated when using time values. The `left` and `right` values of an existing line can be modified using `box.set_left()`, `box.set_right()`, `box.set_lefttop()` or `box.set_rightbottom()`.

**xloc**

Is either `xloc.bar_index` (the default) or `xloc.bar_time`. It determines which type of argument must be used with `left` and `right`. With `xloc.bar_index`, `left` and `right` must be absolute bar indices. With `xloc.bar_time`, `left` and `right` must be a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds corresponding to a value between the bar's `time` (opening time) and `time_close` (closing time) values.

**top and bottom**

They are the y coordinates of the boxes' top and bottom levels (boxes are always rectangular). While they are called price levels, they must be of values that make sense in the script's visual space. For an RSI indicator, they would typically be between 0 and 100, for example. When an indicator is running as an overlay, then the price scale will usually be that of the chart's symbol. The `top` and `bottom` values of an existing line can be modified using `box.set_top()`, `box.set_bottom()`, `box.set_lefttop()` or `box.set_rightbottom()`.

The remaining five parameters in `box.new()` control the visual appearance of boxes:

**border_color**

Is the border's color. It defaults to `color.blue`.

**border_width**

Determines the width of the border in pixels.

**border_style**

Is the style of border. See this page's Box styles section.

**extend**

Determines if the borders is extended past the box's coordinates. It can be `extend.none`, `extend.left`, `extend.right` or `extend.both`.

**bgcolor**

Is the background color of the box. It defaults to `color.blue`.

Let's create simple boxes:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
```

```python
box.new(bar_index, high, bar_index + 1, low, border_color = color.gray, bgcolor = colo
```

Note that:
* The start and end points of boxes, like lines, are always the horizontal center of bars.
* We start these boxes at `bar_index` and end them on `bar_index + 1` (the following bar in the future) so
that we get an actual box. If we used `bar_index` for both coordinates, only a vertical line would be drawn in
the center of the bar.
* No logic controls our `box.new()` call, so boxes are created on every bar.
* Only approximately the last 50 boxes are shown because that is the default value for the `max_boxes_count`
parameter in `indicator()`, which we haven't specified.
* Boxes persist on bars until your script deletes them using `box.delete()`, or garbage collection removes them.

Modifying boxes
The available setter functions for box drawings are:

* `box.set_left()`
* `box.set_top()`
* `box.set_lefttop()`
* `box.set_right()`
* `box.set_bottom()`
* `box.set_rightbottom()`
* `box.set_border_color()`
* `box.set_border_width()`
* `box.set_border_style()`
* `box.set_extend()`
* `box.set_bgcolor()`

Note that contrary to lines, there is no setter function to modify `xloc` for boxes.

This script uses setter functions to update boxes. It detects the largest up and down volume bars during a user-
defined timeframe and draws boxes with the `high` and `low` levels of those bars. If a higher volume bar comes in, the
timeframe's box is redrawn using the new bar's `high` and `low` levels:

# Non-standard charts data

*   Introduction
*   `ticker.heikinashi()`
*   `ticker.renko()`
*   `ticker.linebreak()`
*   `ticker.kagi()`
*   `ticker.pointfigure()`

## Introduction

These functions allow scripts to fetch information from non-standard bars or chart types, regardless of the type of chart the script is running on. They are: `ticker.heikinashi()`, `ticker.renko()`, `ticker.linebreak()`, `ticker.kagi()` and `ticker.pointfigure()`. All of them work in the same manner; they create a special ticker identifier to be used as the first argument in a `request.security()` function call.

## `ticker.heikinashi()`

*Heikin-Ashi* means *average bar* in Japanese. The open/high/low/close values of Heikin-Ashi candlesticks are synthetic; they are not actual market prices. They are calculated by averaging combinations of real OHLC values from the current and previous bar. The calculations used make Heikin-Ashi bars less noisy than normal candlesticks. They can be useful to make visual assessments, but are unsuited to backtesting or automated trading, as orders execute on market prices not Heikin-Ashi prices.

The `ticker.heikinashi()` function creates a special ticker identifier for requesting Heikin-Ashi data with the `request.security()` function.

This script requests the close value of Heikin-Ashi bars and plots them on top of the normal candlesticks:

```
//@version=5
indicator("HA Close", "", true)
haTicker = ticker.heikinashi(syminfo.tickerid)
haclose = request.security (haTicker, timeframe.period, close)
plot(haClose, "HA Close", color.black, 3)
```

Note that:

*   The close values for Heikin-Ashi bars plotted as the black line are very different from those of real candles using market prices. They act more like a moving average.
*   The black line appears over the chart bars because we have selected "Visual Order/Bring to Front" from the script's "More" menu.

If you wanted to omit values for extended hours in the last example, an intermediary ticker without extended session information would need to be created first:

```
//@version=5
indicator("HA Close", "", true)
regularSessionTicker = ticker.new(syminfo.prefix, syminfo.ticker, session.regular)
haTicker = ticker.heikinashi(regularSessionTicker)
haclose = request.security(haTicker, timeframe.period, close, gaps = barmerge.gaps_on)
plot(haClose, "HA Close", color.black, 3, plot.style_linebr)
```

Note that:
* We use the ticker.new() function first, to create a ticker without extended session information.
* We use that ticker instead of syminfo.tickerid in our ticker.heikinashi() call.
* In our request.security() call, we set the `gaps` parameter's value to `barmerge.gaps_on`. This instructs the function not to use previous values to fill slots where data is absent. This makes it possible for it to return `na` values outside of regular sessions.
* To be able to see this on the chart, we also need to use a special `plot.style_linebr` style, which breaks the plots on `na` values.

This script plots Heikin-Ashi candles under the chart:



```
//@version=5
indicator("Heikin-Ashi candles")
CANDLE_GREEN = #26A69A
CANDLE_RED = #EF5350

haTicker = ticker.heikinashi(syminfo.tickerid)
[hao, haH, hal, haC] = request.security(haTicker, timeframe.period, open, high, low, close)
candleColor = haC >= hao ? CANDLE_GREEN : CANDLE_RED
plotcandle(hao, haH, hal, haC, color = candleColor)
```

Note that:
* We use a tuple with request.security() to fetch four values with the same call.
* We use plotcandle() to plot our candles. See the Bar plotting page for more information.

## `ticker.renko()`

Renko bars only plot price movements, without taking time or volume into consideration. They look like bricks stacked
in adjacent columns [1]. A new brick is only drawn after the price passes the top or bottom by a predetermined
amount. The `ticker.renko()` function creates a ticker id which can be used with `request.security()` to fetch Renko
values, but there is no Pine Script ™ function to draw Renko bars on the chart:

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
renkoTicker = ticker.renko(syminfo.tickerid, "ATR", 10)
renkoLow = request.security(renkoTicker, timeframe.period, low)
plot(renkoLow)
```

## `ticker.linebreak()`
The Line Break chart type displays a series of vertical boxes that are based on price changes [1]. The
`ticker.linebreak()` function creates a ticker id which can be used with `request.security()` to fetch "Line Break" values,
but there is no Pine Script ™ function to draw such bars on the chart:

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
lineBreakTicker = ticker.linebreak(syminfo.tickerid, 3)
lineBreakClose = request.security(lineBreakTicker, timeframe.period, close)
plot(lineBreakClose)
```

## `ticker.kagi()`
Kagi charts are made of a continuous line that changes directions. The direction changes when the price changes [1]
beyond a predetermined amount. The `ticker.kagi()` function creates a ticker id which can be used with
`request.security()` to fetch "Kagi" values, but there is no Pine Script ™ function to draw such bars on the chart:

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
kagiBreakTicker = ticker.linebreak(syminfo.tickerid, 3)
kagiBreakClose = request.security (kagiBreakTicker, timeframe.period, close)
plot(kagiBreakClose)
```

## `ticker.pointfigure()`
Point and Figure (PnF) charts only plot price movements [1], without taking time into consideration. A column of X's
is plotted as the price rises, and O's are plotted when price drops. The `ticker.pointfigure()` function creates a ticker id
which can be used with `request.security()` to fetch "PnF" values, but there is no Pine Script ™ function to draw such
bars on the chart. Every column of X's or O's is represented with four numbers. You may think of them as synthetic
OHLC PnF values:

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
pnfTicker = ticker.pointfigure(syminfo.tickerid, "hl", "ATR", 14, 3)
[pnf0, pnfC] = request.security(pnfTicker, timeframe.period, [open, close], barmerge.gaps_off)
plot(pnf0, "PnF Open", color.green, 4, plot.style_linebr)
plot(pnfC, "PnF Close", color.red, 4, plot.style_linebr)
```

## Footnotes
(1, 2, 3, 4) On TradingView, Renko, Line Break, Kagi and PnF chart types are generated from OHLC values from a
lower timeframe. These chart types thus represent only an approximation of what they would be like if they
were generated from tick data.

# Introduction

The `plot()` function is the most frequently used function used to display information calculated using Pine scripts. It is versatile and can plot different styles of lines, histograms, areas, columns (like volume columns), fills, circles or crosses.

The use of `plot()` to create fills is explained in the page on .

This script showcases a few different uses of `plot()` in an overlay script:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("`plot()`", "", true)
plot(high, "Blue `high` line")
plot(math.avg(close, open), "Crosses in body center", close > open ? color.lime : color.purple, 6, plot.style_cross)
plot(math.min(open, close), "Navy step line on body low point", color.navy, 3, plot.style_stepline)
plot(low, "Gray dot on `low`", color.gray, 3, plot.style_circles)
color VIOLET = #AA00FF
color GOLD = #CCCC00
ma = ta.alma(hl2, 40, 0.85, 6)
var almaColor = color.silver
almaColor := ma > ma[2] ? GOLD : ma < ma[2] ? VIOLET : almaColor
plot(ma, "Two-color ALMA", almaColor, 2)
```

Note that:
*   The first `plot()` call plots a 1-pixel blue line across the bar highs.
*   The second plots crosses at the mid-point of bodies. The crosses are colored lime when the bar is up and purple when it is down. The argument used for `linewidth` is `6` but it is not a pixel value; just a relative size.
*   The third call plots a 3-pixel wide step line following the low point of bodies.
*   The fourth call plot a gray circle at the bars' `low`.
*   The last plot requires some preparation. We first define our bull/bear colors, calculate an Arnaud Legoux Moving Average, then make our color calculations. We initialize our color variable on bar zero only, using `var`. We initialize it to `color.silver`, so on the dataset's first bars, until one of our conditions causes the color to change, the line will be silver. The conditions that change the color of the line require it to be higher/lower than its value two bars ago. This makes for less noisy color transitions than if we merely looked for a higher/lower value than the previous one.

This script shows other uses of `plot()` in a pane:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Volume change", format = format.volume)

color GREEN = #008000
color GREEN_LIGHT = color.new(GREEN, 50)
color GREEN_LIGHTER = color.new(GREEN, 85)
color PINK = #FF0080
color PINK_LIGHT = color.new(PINK, 50)
color PINK_LIGHTER = color.new(PINK, 90)

bool barUp = ta.rising(close, 1)
bool barDn = ta.falling(close, 1)
float volumeChange = ta.change(volume)

volumeColor = barUp ? GREEN_LIGHTER : barDn ? PINK_LIGHTER : color.gray
plot(volume, "Volume columns", volumeColor, style = plot.style_columns)

volumeChangeColor = barUp ? volumeChange > 0 ? GREEN: GREEN_LIGHT : volumeChange > 0 ? PINK : PINK_LIGHT
plot(volumeChange, "Volume change columns", volumeChangeColor, 12, plot.style_histogram)

plot(0, "Zero line", color.gray)
```

Note that:
*   We are plotting normal `volume` values as wide columns above the zero line (see the `style = plot.style_columns` in our `plot()` call).
*   Before plotting the columns we calculate our `volumeColor` by using the values of the `barUp` and `barDn` boolean variables. They become respectively `true` when the current bar's `close` is higher/lower than the previous one. Note that the "Volume” built-in does not use the same condition; it identifies an up bar with `close > open`. We use the `GREEN_LIGHTER` and `PINK_LIGHTER` colors for the volume columns.
*   Because the first plot plots columns, we do not use the `linewidth` parameter, as it has no effect on columns.
*   Our script's second plot is the `change` in volume, which we have calculated earlier using `ta.change(volume)`. This value is plotted as a histogram, for which the `linewidth` parameter controls the width of the column. We make this width `12` so that histogram elements are thinner than the columns of the first plot. Positive/negative `volumeChange` values plot above/below the zero line; no manipulation is required to achieve this effect.
*   Before plotting the histogram of `volumeChange` values, we calculate its color value, which can be one of four different colors. We use the bright `GREEN` or `PINK` colors when the bar is up/down AND the volume has increased since the last bar (`volumeChange > 0`). Because `volumeChange` is positive in this case, the histogram's element will be plotted above the zero line. We use the bright `GREEN_LIGHT` or `PINK_LIGHT` colors when the bar is up/down AND the volume has NOT increased since the last bar. Because `volumeChange` is negative in this case, the histogram's element will be plotted below the zero line.
*   Finally, we plot a zero line. We could just as well have used `hline(0)` there.
*   We use `format = format.volume` in our `indicator()` call so that large values displayed for this script are abbreviated like those of the built-in "Volume" indicator.

`plot()` calls must always be placed in a line's first position, which entails they are always in the script's global scope. They can't be placed in user-defined functions or structures like `if`, `for`, etc. Calls to `plot()` can, however, be designed to plot conditionally in two ways, which we cover in the Conditional plots section of this page.

A script can only plot in its own visual space, whether it is in a pane or on the chart as an overlay. Scripts running in a pane can only color bars in the chart area.

`plot()` parameters

The `plot()` function has the following signature:

```pine
plot(series, title, color, linewidth, style, trackprice, histbase, offset, join, editable, show_last, display)
```

The parameters of `plot()` are:

`series`

It is the only mandatory parameter. Its argument must be of "series int/float" type. Note that because the auto-casting rules in Pine Script ™™™ convert in the int A float bool direction, a "bool” type variable cannot be used as is; it must be converted to an "int" or a "float" for use as an argument. For example, if `newDay` is of "bool" type, then `newDay ? 1 : 0` can be used to plot 1 when the variable is `true`, and zero when it is `false`.

`title`

Requires a "const string" argument, so it must be known at compile time. The string appears:

*   In the script's scale when the "Chart settings/Scales/Indicator Name Label" field is checked.
*   In the Data Window.
*   In the "Settings/Style" tab.
*   In the dropdown of `input.source()` fields.
*   In the "Condition" field of the "Create Alert" dialog box, when the script is selected.
*   As the column header when exporting chart data to a CSV file.

`color`

Accepts "series color", so can be calculated on the fly, bar by bar. Plotting with `na` as the color, or any color with a transparency of 100, is one way to hide plots when they are not needed.

`linewidth`

Is the plotted element's size, but it does not apply to all styles. When a line is plotted, the unit is pixels. It has no impact when `plot.style_columns` is used.

`style`

The available arguments are:

*   `plot.style_line` (the default): It plots a continous line using the `linewidth` argument in pixels for its width. `na` values will not plot as a line, but they will be bridged when a value that is not `na` comes in. Non-`na` values are only bridged if they are visible on the chart.
*   `plot.style_linebr`: Allows the plotting of discontinuous lines by not plotting on `na` values, and not joining gaps, i.e., bridging over `na` values.
*   `plot.style_stepline`: Plots using a staircase effect. Transitions between changes in values are done using a vertical line drawn in middle of bars, as opposed to a point-to-point diagonal joining the midpoints of bars. Can also be used to achieve an effect similar to that of `plot.style_linebr`, but only if care is taken to plot no color on `na` values.
*   `plot.style_area`: plots a line of `linewidth` width, filling the area between the line and the `histbase`. The `color` argument is used for both the line and the fill. You can make the line a different color by using another `plot()` call. Positive values are plotted above the `histbase`, negative values below it.
*   `plot.style_areabr`: This is similar to `plot.style_area` but it doesn't bridge over `na` values. Another difference is how the indicator's scale is calculated. Only the plotted values serve in the calculation of the y range of the script's visual space. If only high values situated far away from the `histbase` are plotted, for example, those values will be used to calculate the y scale of the script's visual space. Positive values are plotted above the `histbase`, negative values below it.
*   `plot.style_columns`: Plots columns similar to those of the "Volume" built-in indicator. The `linewidth` value does not affect the width of the columns. Positive values are plotted above the `histbase`, negative values below it. Always includes the value of `histbase` in the y scale of the script's visual space.
*   `plot.style_histogram`: Plots columns similar to those of the "Volume" built-in indicator, except that the `linewidth` value is used to determine the width of the histogram's bars in pixels. Note that since `linewidth` requires an "input int" value, the width of the histogram's bars cannot vary bar to bar. Positive values are plotted above the `histbase`, negative values below it. Always includes the value of `histbase` in the y scale of the script's visual space.
*   `plot.style_circles` and `plot.style_cross`: These plot a shape that is not joined across bars unless `join = true` is also used. For these styles, the `linewidth` argument becomes a relative sizing measure its units are not pixels.

trackprice
The default value of this is `false`. When it is `true`, a dotted line made up of small squares will be plotted the full width of the script's visual space. It is often used in conjuction with `show_last = 1`, `offset = -99999` to hide the actual plot and only leave the residual dotted line.

histbase
It is the reference point used with `plot.style_area`, `plot.style_columns` and `plot.style_histogram`. It determines the level separating positive and negative values of the `series` argument. It cannot be calculated dynamically, as an "input int/float" is required.

offset
This allows shifting the plot in the past/future using a negative/positive offset in bars. The value cannot change during the script's execution.

join
This only affect styles `plot.style_circles` or `plot.style_cross`. When `true`, the shapes are joined by a one-pixel line.

editable
This boolean parameter controls whether or not the plot's properties can be edited in the “Settings/Style" tab. Its default value is `true`.

show_last
Allows control over how many of the last bars the plotted values are visible. An "input int" argument is required, so it cannot be calculated dynamically.

display
The default is `display.all`. When it is set to `display.none`, plotted values will not affect the scale of the script's visual space. The plot will be invisible and will not appear in indicator values or the Data Window. It can be useful in plots destined for use as external inputs for other scripts, or for plots used with the
`{{plot("[plot_title]")}}` placeholder in `alertcondition()` calls, e.g.:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("")
r = ta.rsi(close, 14)
xUp = ta.crossover(r, 50)
plot(r, "RSI", display = display.none)
alertcondition(xUp, "xUp alert", message = 'RSI is bullish at: {{plot("RSI")}}')
```

Plotting conditionally
`plot()` calls cannot be used in conditional structures such as `if`, but they can be controlled by varying their plotted values, or their color. When no plot is required, you can either plot `na` values, or plot values using `na` color or any color with 100 transparency (which also makes it invisible).

Value control
One way to control the display of plots is to plot `na` values when no plot is needed. Sometimes, values returned by functions such as `request.security()` will return `na` values, when `gaps = barmerge.gaps_on` is used, for example. In both these cases it is sometimes useful to plot discontinuous lines. This script shows a few ways to do it:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Discontinuous plots", "", true)
bool plotValues = bar_index % 3 == 0
plot(plotValues ? high: na, color = color.fuchsia, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_linebr)
plot(plotValues ? high: na)
plot(plotValues ? math.max(open, close) : na, color = color.navy, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_cross)
plot(plotValues ? math.min(open, close) : na, color = color.navy, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_circles)
plot(plotValues ? low: na, color = plotValues ? color.green: na, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_stepline)
```

Note that:
* We define the condition determining when we plot using `bar_index % 3 == 0`, which becomes `true` when
the remainder of the division of the bar index by 3 is zero. This will happen every three bars.
* In the first plot, we use `plot.style_linebr`, which plots the fuchsia line on highs. It is centered on the bar's
horizontal midpoint.
* The second plot shows the result of plotting the same values, but without using special care to break the line.
What's happening here is that the thin blue line of the plain `plot()` call is automatically bridged over `na` values
(or gaps), so the plot does not interrupt.
* We then plot navy blue crosses and circles on the body tops and bottoms. The `plot.style_circles` and
`plot.style_cross` style are a simple way to plot discontinuous values, e.g., for stop or take profit levels, or
support & resistance levels.
* The last plot in green on the bar lows is done using `plot.style_stepline`. Note how its segments are wider than
the fuchsia line segments plotted with `plot.style_linebr`. Also note how on the last bar, it only plots halfway
until the next bar comes in.
* The plotting order of each plot is controlled by their order of appearance in the script.
This script shows how you can restrict plotting to bars after a user-defined date. We use the `input.time()` function to
create an input widget allowing script users to select a date and time, using Jan 1st 2021 as its default value:
```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
startInput = input.time(timestamp("2021-01-01"))
plot(time > startInput ? close: na)
```
Color control

The Conditional coloring section of the page on colors discusses color control for plots. We'll look here at a few
examples.
The value of the `color` parameter in `plot()` can be a constant, such as one of the built-in constant colors or a color
literal. In Pine Script™, the form-type of such colors is called "const color" (see the Type system page). They are
known at compile time:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
plot(close, color = color.gray)
```

The color of a plot can also be determined using information that is only known when the script begins execution on
the first historical bar of a chart (bar zero, i.e., `bar_index == 0` or `barstate.isfirst == true`), as will be
the case when the information needed to determine a color depends on the chart the script is running on. Here, we
calculate a plot color using the `syminfo.type` built-in variable, which returns the type of the chart's symbol. The form-
type of `plotColor` in this case will be "simple color":

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
plotColor = switch syminfo.type
    "stock"   => color.purple
    "futures" => color.red
    "index"   => color.gray
    "forex"   => color.fuchsia
    "crypto"  => color.lime
    "fund"    => color.orange
    "dr"      => color.aqua
    "cfd"     => color.blue
plot(close, color = plotColor)
printTable(txt) => var table t = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1), table.cell(t, 0, 0, txt)
printTable(syminfo.type)
```

Plot colors can also be chosen through a script's inputs. In this case, the `lineColorInput` variable is of form-type
"input color":

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
color lineColorInput = input(#1848CC, "Line color")
plot(close, color = lineColorInput)
```

Finally, plot colors can also be a dynamic value, i.e., a calculated value that is only known on each bar. These are of
form-type "series color":

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
plotColor = close >= open ? color.lime : color.red
plot(close, color = plotColor)
```

When plotting pivot levels, one common requirement is to avoid plotting level transitions. Using lines is one
alternative, but you can also use `plot()` like this:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Pivot plots", "", true)
pivotHigh = fixnan(ta.pivothigh(3,3))
plot(pivotHigh, "High pivot", ta.change (pivotHigh) ? na: color.olive, 3)
plotchar(ta.change(pivotHigh), "ta.change (pivotHigh)", ".", location.top, size = size.small)
```

Note that:

• We use `pivotHigh = fixnan(ta.pivothigh(3,3))` to hold our pivot values. Because `ta.pivothigh()` only returns a value when a new pivot is found, we use `fixnan()` to fill the gaps with the last pivot value returned. The gaps here refer to the `na` values `ta.pivothigh()` returns when no new pivot is found.
• Our pivots are detected three bars after they occur because we use the argument `3` for both the `leftbars` and `rightbars` parameters in our `ta.pivothigh()` call.
• The last plot is plotting a continuous value, but it is setting the plot's color to `na` when the pivot's value changes, so the plot isn't visible then. Because of this, a visible plot will only appear on the bar following the one where we plotted using `na` color.
• The blue dot indicates when a new high pivot is detected and no plot is drawn between the preceding bar and that one. Note how the pivot on the bar indicated by the arrow has just been detected in the realtime bar, three bars later, and how no plot is drawn. The plot will only appear on the next bar, making the plot visible four bars after the actual pivot.

## Levels

Pine Script™ has an `hline()` function to plot horizontal lines (see the page on ). `hline()` is useful because it has some line styles unavailable with `plot()`, but it also has some limitations, namely that it does not accept "series color", and that its `price` parameter requires an "input int/float”, so cannot vary during the script's execution.

You can plot levels with `plot()` in a few different ways. This shows a CCI indicator with levels plotted using `plot()`:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("CCI levels with `plot()`")
plot(ta.cci(close, 20))
plot(0, "Zero", color.gray, 1, plot.style_circles)
plot(bar_index % 2 == 0 ? 100 : na, "100", color.lime, 1, plot.style_linebr)
plot(bar_index % 2 == 0 ? -100 : na, "-100", color.fuchsia, 1, plot.style_linebr)
plot(200, "200", color.green, 2, trackprice = true, show_last = 1, offset = -99999)
plot(-200, "-200", color.red, 2, trackprice = true, show_last = 1, offset = -99999)
plot(300, "300", color.new(color.green, 50), 1)
plot(-300, "-300", color.new(color.red, 50), 1)
```

Note that:

*   The zero level is plotted using `plot.style_circles`.
*   The 100 levels are plotted using a conditional value that only plots every second bar. In order to prevent the `na` values from being bridged, we use the `plot.style_linebr` line style.
*   The 200 levels are plotted using `trackprice = true` to plot a distinct pattern of small squares that extends the full width of the script's visual space. The `show_last = 1` in there displays only the last plotted value, which would appear as a one-bar straight line if the next trick wasn't also used: the `offset = -99999` pushes that one-bar segment far away in the past so that it is never visible.
*   The 300 levels are plotted using a continuous line, but a lighter transparency is used to make them less prominent.

## Offsets

The `offset` parameter specifies the shift used when the line is plotted (negative values shift in the past, positive values shift into the future. For example:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
plot(close, color = color.red, offset = -5)
plot(close, color = color.lime, offset = 5)
```

As can be seen in the screenshot, the red series has been shifted to the left (since the argument's value is negative),
while the green series has been shifted to the right (its value is positive).

## Plot count limit

Each script is limited to a maximum plot count of 64. All `plot*()` calls and `alertcondition()` calls count in the plot
count of a script. Some types of calls count for more than one in the total plot count.

`plot()` calls count for one in the total plot count if they use a "const color" argument for the `color` parameter,
which means it is known at compile time, e.g.:

```pine
plot(close, color = color.green)
```

When they use another form, such as any one of these, they will count for two in the total plot count:

```pine
plot(close, color = syminfo.mintick > 0.0001 ? color.green : color.red) // AA "simple color"
plot(close, color = input.color(color.purple)) //AA "input color"
plot(close, color = close > open ? color.green : color.red) // AA "series color"
plot(close, color = color.new(color.silver, close > open ? 40 : 0)) //AA "series color"
```

## Scale

Not all values can be plotted everywhere. Your script's visual space is always bound by upper and lower limits that
are dynamically adjusted with the values plotted. An `RSI` indicator will plot values between 0 and 100, which is why it
is usually displayed in a distinct pane or area above or below the chart. If RSI values were plotted as an overlay
on the chart, the effect would be to distort the symbol's normal price scale, unless it just hapenned to be close to
RSI's 0 to 100 range. This shows an RSI signal line and a centerline at the 50 level, with the script running in a
separate pane:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("RSI")
myRSI =
ta.rsi (close, 20)
bullColor = color.from_gradient(myRSI, 50, 80, color.new(color.lime, 70), color.new(color.lime, 0))
bearColor = color.from_gradient(myRSI, 20, 50, color.new(color.red, 0), color.new(color.red, 70))
myRSIColor = myRSI > 50 ? bullColor : bearColor
plot(myRSI, "RSI", myRSIColor, 3)
hline (50)
```

Note that the y axis of our script's visual space is automatically sized using the range of values plotted, i.e., the
values of RSI. See the page on Colors for more information on the color.from_gradient() function used in the script.

If we try to plot the symbol's `close` values in the same space by adding the following line to our script:

`plot(close)`

This is what happens:

The chart is on the BTCUSD symbol, whose `close` prices are around 40000 during this period. Plotting values in the
40000 range makes our RSI plots in the 0 to 100 range indiscernible. The same distorted plots would occur if we placed
the RSI indicator on the chart as an overlay.

## Merging two indicators

If you are planning to merge two signals in one script, first consider the scale of each. It is impossible, for example, to
correctly plot an RSI and a MACD in the same script's visual space because RSI has a fixed range (0 to 100) while MACD
doesn't, as it plots moving averages calculated on price._

If both your indicators used fixed ranges, you can shift the values of one of them so they do not overlap. We could, for
example, plot both RSI (0 to 100) and the True Strength Indicator (TSI) (-100 to +100) by displacing one of them. Our
strategy here will be to compress and shift the TSI values so they plot over RSI:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("RSI and TSI")
myRSI = ta.rsi(close, 20)
bullColor = color.from_gradient(myRSI, 50, 80, color.new(color.lime, 70), color.new(color.lime, 0))
bearColor = color.from_gradient(myRSI, 20, 50, color.new(color.red, 70), color.new(color.red, 70))
myRSIColor = myRSI > 50 ? bullColor : bearColor
plot(myRSI, "RSI", myRSIColor, 3)
hline(100)
hline(50)
hline(0)

// 1. Compress TSI's range from -100/100 to -50/50.
// 2. Shift it higher by 150, so its -50 min value becomes 100.
myTSI = 150 + (100 * ta.tsi(close, 13, 25) / 2)
plot(myTSI, "TSI", color.blue, 2)
plot(ta.ema(myTSI, 13), "TSI EMA", #3FF006E)
hline(200)
hline(150)
```

Note that:
*   We have added levels using `hline` to situate both signals.
*   In order for both signal lines to oscillate on the same range of 100, we divide the TSI value by 2 because it has a 200 range (-100 to +100). We then shift this value up by 150 so it oscillates between 100 and 200, making 150 its centerline.
*   The manipulations we make here are typical of the compromises required to bring two indicators with different scales in the same visual space, even when their values, contrary to MACD, are bounded in a fixed range.

## Introduction

We define repainting as: script behavior causing historical vs realtime calculations or plots to behave differently.

Repainting behavior is widespread and can be caused by many factors. Following our definition, our estimate is that more than 95% of indicators in existence repaint. Widely used indicators like MACD and RSI, for example, exhibit one form of repainting because they show one value on historical bars, yet when running in realtime they will produce results that constantly fluctuate until the realtime bar closes. They thus behave differently on historical and realtime bars. This does not necessarily make them less useful in all contexts, nor prevent knowledgeable traders from using them. Who would think of discrediting a volume profile indicator, for example because it updates in real time, and so repaints?

The different types of repainting we discuss in this page can be divided this way:

* Widespread and often acceptable: recalculation during the realtime bar (most classic indicators like MACD, RSI, and the vast majority of indicators in the Community Scripts, scripts using repainting `request.security()` calls, etc.). There is often nothing wrong in using such scripts, provided you understand how they work. If you elect to use these scripts to issue alerts or trade orders, however, then you should know if they are being generated using the realtime or confirmed values, and decide for yourself if the script's behavior meets your requirements.
* Misleading: plotting in the past, calculating results in realtime that cannot be replicated on historical bars, relocating past events (Ichimoku, most pivot scripts, most strategies using `calc_on_evey_tick = true,` scripts using repainting `request.security()` calls when their values are plotted on historical bars, as their behavior
will not be the same in realtime, most scripts using `varip`, most scripts using `timenow`, some scripts using
`barstate.*` variables).
* Unacceptable: scripts using future information, strategies running on non-standard charts, scripts using realtime
intrabar timeframes to generate alerts or orders.
* Unavoidable: revision of historical feeds by data suppliers, varying starting bar on historical bars.

The first two types of repainting can be perfectly acceptable if:

1. You are aware of the behavior.
2. You can live with it, or
3. You can circumvent it.

It should now be clear to you that not all repainting behavior is inherently wrong and should be avoided at all cost. In
many situations, repainting indicators are exactly what's needed. What's important is to know when repainting
behavior is not acceptable to you. To avoid such situations, you must understand exactly how the tools you use work,
or how you should design the ones you build. If you publish scripts, any potentially misleading repainting behavior
should be mentioned along with the other limitations of your script.

Note

We will not discuss the perils of using strategies on non-standard charts, as this problem is not related to
repainting. See the Backtesting on Non-Standard Charts: Caution! script for a discussion of the subject.

## For script users

You can very well decide to use repainting indicators if you understand how they behave, and that behavior meets
your trading methodology's requirements. Don't be one of those newcomers to trading who slap "repaint" sentences
on published scripts as if it discredits them. Doing so only reveals your incomprehension of the subject.

The question "Does it repaint?" means nothing. Consequently, it cannot be answered in a meaningful way. Why?
Because it needs to be qualified. Instead, one could ask:

* Do you wait for the realtime bar to close before displaying your entry/exit markers?
* Do alerts wait for the end of the realtime bar before triggering?
* Do the higher timeframe plots repaint (which means they won't plot the same way on realtime bars as they do
on historical bars)?
* Does your script plot in the past (as most pivot or zigzag scripts will do)?
* Does your strategy use `calc_on_every_tick = true`?
* Will your indicator display in realtime the same way it does on historical bars?
* Are you fetching future information with your `request.security()` calls?

What's important is that you understand how the tools you use work, and if their behavior is compatible with your
objectives, repainting or not. As you will learn if you read this page, repainting is a complex matter. It has many faces
and many causes. Even if you don't program in Pine Script™, this page will help you understand the array of causes
that can lead to repainting, and hopefully enable more meaningful discussions with script authors.

## For Pine Script ™ programmers

As we discussed in the previous section, not all types of repainting behavior need to be avoided at all costs, and as we
will see in the following text, some can't. We hope this page helps you better understand the dynamics at play, so
that you can make better design decisions concerning your trading tools. This page's content should help you avoid
making the most common coding mistakes that lead to repainting or misleading plots.

Whatever your design decisions are, if you publish your script, you should explain them to traders so they can
understand how your script behaves.

We will survey three broad categories of repainting causes:
• Historical vs realtime calculations
• Plotting in the past
• Dataset variations

# Historical vs realtime calculations

## Fluid data values

Historical data does not include records of intermediary price movements on bars; only open, high, low and close values (OHLC).

On realtime bars (bars running when the instrument's market is open), however, the high, low and close values are not fixed; they can change values many times before the realtime bar closes and its HLC values are fixed. They are *fluid*. This leads to a script sometimes working differently on historical data and in real time, where only the open price will not change during the bar.

Any script using values like high, low and close in realtime is subject to producing calculations that may not be repeatable on historical bars - thus repaint.

Let's look at this simple script. It detects crosses of the close value (in the realtime bar, this corresponds to the current price of the instrument) over and under an EMA:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Repainting", "", true)
ma = ta.ema(close, 5)
xUp = ta.crossover(close, ma)
xDn = ta.crossunder(close, ma)
plot(ma, "MA", color.black, 2)
bgcolor(xUp ? color.new(color.lime, 80) : xDn ? color.new(color.fuchsia, 80) : na)
```

Note that:
• The script uses `bgcolor()` to color the background green when close crosses over the EMA, and red on crosses under the EMA.
• The screen snapshot shows the script in realtime on a 30sec chart. A cross over the EMA has been detected, thus the background of the realtime bar is green.
• The problem here is that nothing guarantees this condition will hold true until the end of the realtime bar. The
arrow points to the timer showing that 21 seconds remain in the realtime bar, and anything could happen until
then.
• We are witnessing a repainting script.

To prevent this repainting, we must rewrite our script so that it does not use values that fluctuate during the realtime
bar. This will require using values from a bar that has elapsed (typically the preceding bar), or the `open` price, which
does not vary in realtime.

We can achieve this in many ways. This method adds a `and barstate.isconfirmed` condition to our cross
detections, which requires the script to be executing on the bar's last iteration, when it closes and prices are
confirmed. It is a simple way to avoid repainting:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Repainting", "", true)
ma = ta.ema(close, 5)
xUp = ta.crossover(close, ma) and barstate.isconfirmed
xDn = ta.crossunder(close, ma) and barstate.isconfirmed
plot(ma, "MA", color.black, 2)
bgcolor(xUp ? color.new(color.lime, 80) : xDn ? color.new(color.fuchsia, 80) : na)
```

This uses the crosses detected on the previous bar:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Repainting", "", true)
ma = ta.ema(close, 5)
xUp = ta.crossover(close, ma)[1]
xDn = ta.crossunder(close, ma)[1]
plot(ma, "MA", color.black, 2)
bgcolor(xUp ? color.new(color.lime, 80) : xDn ? color.new(color.fuchsia, 80) : na)
```

This uses only confirmed `close` and EMA values for its calculations:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Repainting", "", true)
ma = ta.ema(close[1], 5)
xUp = ta.crossover(close[1], ma)
xDn = ta.crossunder(close[1], ma)
plot(ma, "MA", color.black, 2)
bgcolor(xUp ? color.new(color.lime, 80) : xDn ? color.new(color.fuchsia, 80) : na)
```

This detects crosses between the realtime bar's `open` and the value of the EMA from the previous bars. Notice that
the EMA is calculated using `close`, so it repaints. We must ensure we use a confirmed value to detect crosses, thus
`ma[1]` in the cross detection logic:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Repainting", "", true)
ma = ta.ema(close, 5)
xUp = ta.crossover(open, ma[1])
xDn = ta.crossunder(open, ma[1])
plot(ma, "MA", color.black, 2)
bgcolor(xUp ? color.new(color.lime, 80) : xDn ? color.new(color.fuchsia, 80) : na)
```

Note that all these methods have one thing in common: while they prevent repainting, they will also trigger
signals later than repainting scripts. This is an inevitable compromise if one wants to avoid repainting. You just
can't have your cake and eat it too.

## Repainting `request.security()` calls

The data fetched with `request.security()` will differ on historical and realtime bars if the function is not used in the
correct manner. Repainting `request.security()` calls will produce historical data and plots that cannot be replicated in
realtime. Let's look at a script showing the difference between repainting and non-repainting `request.security()` calls:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Repainting vs non-repainting `request.security()`", "", true)
var BLACK_MEDIUM = color.new(color.black, 50)
var ORANGE_LIGHT = color.new(color.orange, 80)

tfInput = input.timeframe("1")

repaintingClose = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, tfInput, close)
plot(repaintingClose, "Repainting close", BLACK_MEDIUM, 8)

indexHighTF = barstate.isrealtime ? 1 : 0
indexCurrTF = barstate.isrealtime ? 0: 1
nonRepaintingClose = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, tfInput, close [indexHighTF])[indexCurrTF]
plot(nonRepaintingClose, "Non-repainting close", color.fuchsia, 3)

if ta.change (time(tfInput))
    label.new(bar_index, na, "o", yloc = yloc.abovebar, style = label.style_none, textcolor = color.black,
      bgcolor = barstate.isrealtime ? ORANGE_LIGHT : na)
```

This is what its output looks like on a 5sec chart that has been running the script for a few minutes:

![Chart Image]

Note that:

*   The orange background identifies the realtime bar, and elapsed realtime bars.
*   A black curved arrow indicates when a new higher timeframe comes in.
*   The thick gray line shows the repainting `request.security()` call used to initialize `repaintingClose`.
*   The fuchsia line shows the non-repainting `request.security()` call used to initialize `nonRepaintingClose`.
*   The behavior of the repainting line is completely different on historical bars and in realtime. On historical bars,
    it shows the new value of a completed timeframe on the `close` of the bar where it completes. It then stays stable
    until another timeframe completes. The problem is that in realtime, it follows the current `close` price, so it
    moves all the time and changes on each bar.
*   The behavior of the non-repainting fuchsia line, in contrast, behaves exactly the same way on historical bars and
    in realtime. It updates on the bar following the completion of the higher timeframe, and doesn't move until the
bar after another higher timeframe completes. It is more reliable and does not mislead script users. Note that
while new higher timeframe data comes in at the `close` of historical bars, it will be available on the `open` of the
same bar in realtime.

This script shows a `nonRepaintingSecurity()` function that can be used to do the same as our non-repainting
code in the previous example:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Non-repainting `nonRepaintingSecurity()`", "", true)

tfInput = input.timeframe("1")

nonRepaintingSecurity(sym, tf, src) =>
    request.security(sym, tf, src[barstate.isrealtime ? 1 : 0]) [barstate.isrealtime ? (

nonRepaintingClose = nonRepaintingSecurity(syminfo.tickerid, "1", close)
plot(nonRepaintingClose, "Non-repainting close", color.fuchsia, 3)
```

Another way to produce non-repainting higher timeframe data is this, which uses an offset of `[1]` on the series, and
`lookahead`:

```pine
nonRepaintingSecurityAlternate(sym, tf, src) =>
    request.security(sym, tf, src[1], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)
```

It will produce the same non-repainting behavior as `nonRepaintingSecurity()`. Note that the `[1]` offset to the
series and the use of `lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on` are interdependent. One cannot be removed
without compromising the functionality of the function. Also note that occasional one-bar variations between when
the `nonRepaintingSecurity()` and `nonRepaintingSecurityAlternate()` values come in on historical bars
are to be expected.

## Using `request.security()` at lower timeframes

Some scripts use `request.security()` to request data from a timeframe lower than the chart's timeframe. This can be
useful when functions specifically designed to handle intrabars at lower timeframes are sent down the timeframe.
When this type of user-defined function requires the detection of the intrabars' first bar, as most do, the technique
will only work on historical bars. This is due to the fact that realtime intrabars are not yet sorted. The impact of this
is that such scripts cannot reproduce in real time their behavior on historical bars. Any logic generating alerts, for
example, will be flawed, and constant refreshing will be required to recalculate elapsed realtime bars as historical
bars.

When used at lower timeframes than the chart's without specialized functions able to distinguish between intrabars,
`request.security()` will only return the value of the last intrabar in the dilation of the chart's bar, which is usually not
useful, and will also not reproduce in real time, so lead to repainting.

For all these reasons, unless you understand the subtleties of using `request.security()` at lower timeframes than the
chart's, it is best to avoid using the function at those timeframes. Higher-quality scripts will have logic to detect such
anomalies and prevent the display of results which would be invalid when a lower timeframe is used.

## Future leak with `request.security()`

When `request.security()` is used with `lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on` to fetch prices without offsetting
the series by `[1]`, it will return data from the future on historical bars, which is dangerously misleading.

While historical bars will magically display future prices before they should be known, no lookahead is possible in
realtime because the future there is unknown, as it should, so no future bars exist.

This is an example:

```pine
// FUTURE LEAK! DO NOT USE!
//@version=5
indicator("Future leak", "", true)
futureHigh = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", high, lookahead = barmerge.lookahead)
plot(futureHigh)
```

Note how the higher timeframe line is showing the timeframe's `high` value before it occurs. The solution is to use the function like we do in our `nonRepaintingSecurity()` shown earlier.

Public scripts using this misleading technique will be moderated.

## `varip`

Scripts using the `varip` declaration mode for variables (see our section on `varip` for more information) save information across realtime updates, which cannot be reproduced on historical bars where only OHLC information is available. Such scripts may be useful in realtime, including to generate alerts, but their logic cannot be backtested, nor can their plots on historical bars reflect calculations that will be done in realtime.

## Bar state built-ins

Scripts using bar states may or may not repaint. As we have seen in the previous section, using `barstate.isconfirmed` is actually one way to avoid repainting that will reproduce on historical bars, which are always “confirmed". Uses of other bar states such as `barstate.isnew`, however, will lead to repainting. The reason is that on historical bars, `barstate.isnew` is `true` on the bar's close, yet in realtime, it is `true` on the bar's open. Using the other bar state variables will usually cause some type of behavioral discrepancy between historical and realtime bars.

## `timenow`

The `timenow` built-in returns the current time. Scripts using this variable cannot show consistent historical and realtime behavior, so they necessarily repaint.

## Strategies

Strategies using `calc_on_every_tick = true` execute on each realtime update, while strategies run on the `close`
of historical bars. They will most probably not generate the same order executions, and so repaint. Note that when
this happens, it also invalidates backtesting results, as they are not representative of the strategy's behavior in
realtime.

## Plotting in the past

Scripts detecting pivots after 5 bars have elapsed will often go back in the past to plot pivot levels or values on the
actual pivot, 5 bars in the past. This will often cause unsuspecting traders looking at plots on historical bars to infer
that when the pivot happens in realtime, the same plots will apppear on the pivot when it occurs, as opposed to
when it is detected.

Let's look at a script showing the price of high pivots by placing the price in the past, 5 bars after the pivot was
detected:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Plotting in the past", "", true)
pHi = ta.pivothigh(5,5)
if not na(pHi)
    label.new(bar_index[5], na, str.tostring(pHi, format.mintick) + "\nA ", yloc = yl
```

Note that:

* This script repaints because an elapsed realtime bar showing no price may get a price placed on it if it is
identified as a pivot, 5 bars after the actual pivot occurs.
* The display looks great, but it can be misleading.

The best solution to this problem when developing script for others is to plot without an offset by default, but give
the option for script users to turn on plotting in the past through inputs, so they are necessarily aware of what the
script is doing, e.g.:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Plotting in the past", "", true)
plotInThePast = input(false, "Plot in the past")
pHi = ta.pivothigh (5,5)
if not na(pHi)
label.new(bar_index[plotInThePast ? 5 : 0], na, str.tostring(pHi, format.mintick) )
```

## Dataset variations

### Starting points

Scripts begin executing on the chart's first historical bar, and then execute on each bar sequentially, as is explained
in this manual's page on Pine Script M's execution model. If the first bar changes, then the script will often not
calculate the same way it did when the dataset began at a different point in time.

The following factors have an impact on the quantity of bars you see on your charts, and their starting point:

*   The type of account you hold
*   The historical data available from the data supplier
*   The alignment requirements of the dataset, which determine its starting point

These are the account-specific bar limits:

*   20000 historical bars for the Premium plan.
*   10000 historical bars for Pro and Pro+ plans.
*   5000 historical bars for other plans.

Starting points are determined using the following rules, which depend on the chart's timeframe:

*   1 - 14 minutes: aligns to the beginning of a week.
*   15 - 29 minutes: aligns to the beginning of a month.
*   30 minutes and higher: aligns to the beginning of a year.

As time goes by, these factors cause your chart's history to start at different points in time. This often has an impact
on your scripts calculations, because changes in calculation results in early bars can ripple through all the other bars
in the dataset. Using functions like `ta.valuewhen()`, `ta.barssince()` or `ta.ema()`, for example, will yield results that
vary with early history.

### Revision of historical data

Historical and realtime bars are built using two different data feeds supplied by exchanges/brokers: historical data,
and realtime data. When realtime bars elapse, exchanges/brokers sometimes make what are usually small
adjustments to bar prices, which are then written to their historical data. When the chart is refreshed or the script is
re-executed on those elapsed realtime bars, they will then be built and calculated using the historical data, which
will contain those usually small price revisions, if any have been made.

Historical data may also be revised for other reasons, e.g., for stock splits.

# Sessions

*   Introduction
*   Session strings
    *   Session string specifications
    *   Using session strings
*   Session states
*   Using sessions with `request.security()`

# Introduction

Session information is usable in three different ways in Pine Script ™:

1.  Session strings containing from-to start times and day information that can be used in functions such as `time()` and `time_close()` to detect when bars are in a particular time period, with the option of limiting valid sessions to specific days. The `input.session()` function provides a way to allow script users to define session values through a script's "Inputs" tab (see the Session input section for more information).
2.  Session states built-in variables such as `session.ismarket` can identify which session a bar belongs to.
3.  When fetching data with `request.security()` you can also choose to return data from regular sessions only or extended sessions. In this case, the definition of regular and extended sessions is that of the exchange. It is part of the instrument's properties not user-defined, as in point #1. This notion of regular and extended sessions is the same one used in the chart's interface, in the "Chart Settings/Symbol/Session" field, for example.

The following sections cover both methods of using session information in Pine Script ™.

Note that:

*   Not all user accounts on TradingView have access to extended session information.
*   There is no special "session" type in Pine Script ™. Instead, session strings are of "string" type but must conform to the session string syntax.

# Session strings

# Session string specifications

Session strings used with `time()` and `time_close()` must have a specific format. Their syntax is:

`<time_period>:<days>`

Where:

• `<time_period>` uses times in "hhmm” format, with “hh” in 24-hour format, so `1700` for 5PM. The time periods
are in the "hhmm-hhmm" format, and a comma can separate multiple time periods to specify combinations of
discrete periods.

For example, - `<days>` is a set of digits from 1 to 7 that specifies on which days the session is valid.
1 is Sunday, 7 is Saturday.

Note
The default days are: `1234567`, which is different in Pine Script™ v5 than in earlier versions where `23456`
(weekdays) is used. For v5 code to reproduce the behavior from previous versions, it should explicitly mention
weekdays, as in `"0930-1700:23456"`.

These are examples of session strings:

`"24x7"`
A 7-day, 24-hour session beginning at midnight.

`"0000-0000:1234567"`
Equivalent to the previous example.

`"0000-0000"`
Equivalent to the previous two examples because the default days are `1234567`.

`"0000-0000:23456"`
The same as the previous example, but only Monday to Friday.

`"2000-1630:1234567"`
An overnight session that begins at 20:00 and ends at 16:30 the next day. It is valid on all days of the week.

`"0930-1700:146"`
A session that begins at 9:30 and ends at 17:00 on Sundays (1), Wednesdays (4), and Fridays (6).

`"1700-1700:23456"`
An overnight session. The Monday session starts Sunday at 17:00 and ends Monday at 17:00. It is valid Monday
through Friday.

`"1000-1001:26"`
A weird session that lasts only one minute on Mondays (2) and Fridays (6).

`"0900-1600,1700-2000"`
A session that begins at 9:00, breaks from 16:00 to 17:00, and continues until 20:00. Applies to every day of the
week.

## Using session strings

Session properties defined with session strings are independent of the exchange-defined sessions determining when an
instrument can be traded. Programmers have complete liberty in creating whatever session definitions suit their
purpose, which is usually to detect when bars belong to specific time periods. This is accomplished in Pine Script™ by
using one of the following two signatures of the `time()` function:

```pine
time (timeframe, session, timezone) → series int
time (timeframe, session) → series int
```

Here, we use `time()` with a `session` argument to display the market's opening `high` and `low` values on an intraday
chart:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Opening high/low", overlay = true)

sessionInput = input.session("0930-0935")

sessionBegins (sess) =>
    t = time("", sess)
    timeframe.isintraday and (not barstate.isfirst) and na(t[1]) and not na(t)

var float hi = na
var float lo = na

if sessionBegins (sessionInput)
    hi := high
    lo := low

plot(lo, "lo", color.fuchsia, 2, plot.style_circles)
plot(hi, "hi", color.lime, 2, plot.style_circles)
```

Note that:

*   We use a session input to allow users to specify the time they want to detect. We are only looking for the session's beginning time on bars, so we use a five-minute gap between the beginning and end time of our `"0930-0935"` default value.
*   We create a `sessionBegins()` function to detect the beginning of a session. Its `time("", sess)` call uses an empty string for the function's `timeframe` parameter, which means it uses the chart's timeframe, whatever that is. The function returns `true` when:
    *   The chart uses an intraday timeframe (seconds or minutes).
    *   The script isn't on the chart's first bar, which we ensure with `(not barstate.isfirst)`. This check prevents the code from always detecting a session beginning on the first bar because `na(t[1]) and not na(t)` is always `true` there.
    *   The `time()` call has returned `na` on the previous bar because it wasn't in the session's time period, and it has returned a value that is not `na` on the current bar, which means the bar is in the session's time period.

Session states
Three built-in variables allow you to distinguish the type of session the current bar belongs to. They are only helpful on intraday timeframes:

• `session.ismarket` returns `true` when the bar belongs to regular trading hours.
• `session.ispremarket` returns `true` when the bar belongs to the extended session preceding regular trading
hours.
• `session.ispostmarket` returns `true` when the bar belongs to the extended session following regular trading
hours.

## Using sessions with `request.security()`

When your TradingView account provides access to extended sessions, you can choose to see their bars with the
"Settings/Symbol/Session" field. There are two types of sessions:
• regular (which does not include pre- and post-market data), and
• extended (which includes pre- and post-market data).

Scripts using the `request.security()` function to access data can return extended session data or not. This is an
example where only regular session data is fetched:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Example 1: Regular Session Data")
regularSessionData = request.security("NASDAQ:AAPL", timeframe.period, close, barmerge.
plot(regularSessionData, style = plot.style_linebr)
```

If you want the `request.security()` call to return extended session data, you must first use the `ticker.new()` function to
build the first argument of the `request.security()` call:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Example 2: Extended Session Data")
t = ticker.new("NASDAQ", "AAPL", session.extended)
extendedSessionData = request.security(t, timeframe.period, close, barmerge.gaps_on)
plot(extendedSessionData, style = plot.style_linebr)
```

Note that the previous chart's gaps in the script's plot are now filled. Also, keep in mind that our example scripts do
not produce the background coloring on the chart; it is due to the chart's settings showing extended hours.

The `ticker.new()` function has the following signature:

```pine
ticker.new(prefix, ticker, session, adjustment)
```

Where:

*   `prefix` is the exchange prefix, e.g., `"NASDAQ"`
*   `ticker` is a symbol name, e.g., `"AAPL"`
*   `session` can be `session.extended` or `session.regular`. Note that this is not a session string.
*   `adjustment` adjusts prices using different criteria: `adjustment.none`, `adjustment.splits`, `adjustment.dividends`.

Our first example could be rewritten as:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Example 1: Regular Session Data")
t = ticker.new("NASDAQ", "AAPL", session.regular)
regularSessionData = request.security(t, timeframe.period, close, barmerge.gaps_on)
plot(regularSessionData, style = plot.style_linebr)
```

If you want to use the same session specifications used for the chart's main symbol, omit the third argument in `ticker.new()`; it is optional. If you want your code to declare your intention explicitly, use the `syminfo.session` built-in variable. It holds the session type of the chart's main symbol:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Example 1: Regular Session Data")
t = ticker.new("NASDAQ", "AAPL", syminfo.session)
regularSessionData = request.security(t, timeframe.period, close, barmerge.gaps_on)
plot(regularSessionData, style = plot.style_linebr)
```

# Strategies

- A simple strategy example
- Applying a strategy to a chart
- Backtesting and forwardtesting
- Broker emulator
- Order placement commands
- Closing market position
- OCA groups
- Risk management
- Currency
- Margin

A strategy is a Pine script that can send, modify and cancel buy/sell orders. Strategies allow you to perform backtesting (emulation of a strategy trading on historical data) and forwardtesting (emulation of a strategy trading on realtime data) according to your algorithms.

A strategy written in Pine Script™ has many of the same capabilities as a Pine Script™ indicator. When you write a strategy, it must start with the `strategy()` function call. Strategies may plot data, but they can also place, modify and cancel orders. They also have access to essential strategy performance information through specific keywords. The same information is available externally in the Strategy Tester tab. Once a strategy is calculated on historical data, you can see hypothetical order fills.

## A simple strategy example

```pine
// @version=5
strategy("test")
if bar_index < 100
    if strategy.position_size <= 0
        strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long, 10)
    else
        strategy.entry("sell", strategy.short, 10)
plot(strategy.initial_capital + strategy.netprofit + strategy.openprofit)
```

As soon as the script is compiled and applied to a chart, you can see filled order marks on it and how your balance was changing during backtesting (equity curve). This is a very basic strategy that buys and sells on every bar.

The `strategy("test")` line states that the script is a strategy named “test”. `strategy.entry()` is a command that can be used to send both "buy" and "sell" orders. `plot(strategy.equity)` plots the equity curve.

## Applying a strategy to a chart

To test your strategy, apply it to the chart. Use the symbol and time intervals that you want to test. You can use a built-in strategy from the Indicators & Strategies dialog box, or write your own.



**Note**

When applying strategies to  (Heikin Ashi, Renko, etc.), it is very important to realize that results will not reflect real market conditions. Orders on these types of charts will be executed at the synthetic price levels used on these charts, which often do not reflect real market prices and thus lead to unrealistic backtesting results. We therefore highly recommend using only standard chart types for backtesting strategies.

## Backtesting and forwardtesting

On TradingView, strategies are calculated on all the chart's available historical data (backtesting), and then automatically continue calculations when real-time data comes in (forwardtesting).

By default, during both historical and real-time calculation, code is calculated on the bar's close.

When forwardtesting, you have the option of configuring script calculation to occur on every real-time tick. To enable this, check the **Recalculate On Every Tick** option in the strategy's Settings/Properties, or specify it in the script's code using: `strategy(..., calc_on_every_tick=true)`.

You can set the strategy to perform one additional calculation after an order is filled. For this you need to check **Recalculate After Order** filled in the strategy's Settings/Properties, or do it in the script's code using: `strategy(..., calc_on_order_fills=true)`.

## Broker emulator

TradingView uses a broker emulator when running strategies. Unlike in real trading, the emulator only fills orders at chart prices, which is why an order can only be filled on the next tick in forwardtesting and on the next bar or later in backtesting, i.e., after the strategy calculates.

The following logic is used to emulate order fills:

1. If the bar's high is closer to bar's open than the bar's low, the broker emulator assumes that intrabar price was moving this way: open → high → low → close.
2. If the bar's low is closer to bar's open than the bar's high, the broker emulator assumes that intrabar price was moving this way: open → low → high → close.
3. The broker emulator assumes that there are no gaps inside bars, meaning the full range of intrabar prices is available for order execution.
4. Even if the `Recalculate On Every Tick` option is enabled in strategy properties (or the script's `strategy` call uses `calc_on_every_tick=true`), the broker emulator's behavior still uses the above logic.

Here is a strategy demonstrating how orders are filled by the broker emulator:

```pine
//@version=5
strategy("History SAW demo", overlay = true, pyramiding = 100, calc_on_order_fills = true)
strategy.entry("LE", strategy.long)
```

This code is calculated once per bar on the close, but an additional calculation occurs as soon as an order is filled.
That is why you can see 4 filled orders on every bar: 2 orders on open, 1 order on high and 1 order on low. This is for
backtesting. In real-time, orders would be executed on every new tick.

It is also possible to emulate an order queue. The setting is called *Verify Price For Limit Orders* and can be found in
strategy properties, or set in the script's code with `strategy(..., backtest_fill_limits_assumption=X)`.
The specified value is a minimum price movements in number of points/pips (default value is 0). A limit order is filled
if the current price is better (higher for sell orders, lower for buy orders) by the specified number of points/pips. The
execution price still matches the limit order price. Example:

*   `backtest_fill_limits_assumption = 1`. Minimum price movement is 0.25.
*   A buy limit order is placed at price `12.50`.
*   Current price is `12.50`.
*   The order cannot be filled at the current price because `backtest_fill_limits_assumption = 1`. To fill
    the order the price must be `0.25*1` lower. The order is put in the queue.
*   Assume that the next tick comes at price `12.00`. This price is 2 points lower, meaning the condition
    `backtest_fill_limits_assumption = 1` is satisfied, so the order should be filled. The order is filled at
    `12.50` (original order price), even if the price is not available anymore.

### Order placement commands

All keywords related to strategies start with a `strategy.` prefix. The following commands are used for placing
orders: `strategy.entry`, `strategy.order` and `strategy.exit`.

`strategy.entry()`

This command only places entry orders. It is affected by the `pyramiding` setting in the strategy's properties
and by the `strategy.risk.allow_entry_in` function. If there is an open market position when an opposite
direction order is generated, the number of contracts/shares/lots/units will be increased by the number of
currently open contracts (script equivalent: `strategy.position_size + quantity`). As a result, the size of
the opened market position will be equal to the order size specified in the `strategy.entry` command.

`strategy.order()`

This command places both entry and exit orders. It is not affected by pyramiding settings or by the
`strategy.risk.allow_entry_in` function. It allows you to create complex entry and exit order
constructions when the functionality of `strategy.entry` and `strategy.exit` will not do.

`strategy.exit()`

This command allows you to exit a market position or form multiple exit order strategies using a stop loss, profit
target or trailing stop. All such orders are part of the same `strategy.oca.reduce` group. An exit order cannot
be placed if there is no open market position or there is no active entry order (an exit order is bound to the ID of
an entry order). It is not possible to exit a position with a market order using the command `strategy.exit`.
For this, the `strategy.close` or `strategy.close_all()` commands should be used. If the number of
contracts/shares/lots/units specified for the `strategy.exit` is less than the size of current open positions, the
exit will be partial. It is possible to exit from the same entry order more than once using the same exit order ID,
which allows you to create exit strategies with multiple levels. In cases where a market position is formed by
multiple entry orders (pyramiding enabled), each exit order must be linked to a matching entry order.

Example 1:

```pine
//@version=5
strategy("revers demo")
if bar_index < 100
    if strategy.position_size <= 0
        strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long, 4)
    else
        strategy.entry("sell", strategy.short, 6)
plot(strategy.initial_capital + strategy.netprofit + strategy.openprofit)
```

The above strategy constantly reverses market position from +4 to -6, back and forth, which the plot shows.

Example 2:

```pine
//@version=5
strategy("exit once demo")
if strategy.position_size <= 0
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long, 4)
strategy.exit("bracket", "buy", 2, profit = 10, stop = 10)
```

This strategy demonstrates a case where a market position is never closed because it uses a partial exit order to close
the market position and it cannot be executed more than once. If you double the line for exiting, the strategy will
close the market position completely.

Example 3:

```pine
//@version=5
strategy("Partial exit demo")
if bar_index < 100 and strategy.position_size <= 0
    strategy.entry("buy", strategy.long, 4)
strategy.exit("bracket1", "buy", 2, profit = 10, stop = 10)
strategy.exit("bracket2", "buy", profit = 20, stop = 20)
```

This code generates 2 levels of brackets (2 take profit orders and 2 stop loss orders). Both levels are activated at the
same time: first level to exit 2 contracts and the second one to exit all the rest.

The first take profit and stop loss orders (level 1) are in an OCA group. The other orders (level 2) are in another OCA
group. This means that as the order from level 1 is filled, the orders from level 2 are not cancelled; they stay active.

Every command placing an order has an ID (string value) which is a unique order identifier. If an order with the same
ID is already placed but not yet filled, the last command modifies the existing order. If modification is not possible
(conversion from buy to sell), the old order is cancelled and the new order is placed. `strategy.entry` and
`strategy.order` work with the same IDs (they can modify the same entry order). `strategy.exit` works with
other order IDs (it is possible to have an entry order and an exit order with the same ID).

To cancel a specific order using its ID, the `strategy.cancel(string ID)` command should be used. To cancel all pending
orders the `strategy.cancel_all()` command should be used. Strategy orders are placed as soon as their conditions are
satisfied and command is called in code. The broker emulator doesn't execute orders before the next tick comes after
the code was calculated, while in real trading an order can get filled sooner. When a market order is generated at the
close of the current bar, the broker emulator only executes it at the open price of the next.

Example:

```pine
//@version=5
strategy("next bar open execution demo")
if bar_index < 100
    if strategy.position_size == 0
        strategy.order("buy", strategy.long)
    else
        strategy.order("sell", strategy.short)
```

If this code is applied to a chart, all orders are filled at the open of every bar.

Conditions for order placement (`when`, `pyramiding`, `strategy.risk`) are checked when the script is
calculated. If all conditions are satisfied, the order is placed. If any condition is not satisfied, the order is not placed.
It is important to cancel price orders (limit, stop and stop-limit orders).

Example (for MSFT, 1D):

```pine
//@version=5
strategy("Priced Entry demo")
var C = 0
if year > 2020
    c:= c + 1
if c == 1
    strategy.entry("LE1", strategy.long, 2, stop = high + 35 * syminfo.mintick)
    strategy.entry("LE2", strategy.long, 2, stop = high + 2* syminfo.mintick)
```

Even though pyramiding is disabled, both these orders are filled in backtesting because when they are generated
there is no opened long market position. Both orders are placed and when price satisfies order execution conditions,
they both get executed. It is recommended to put the orders in an OCA group using `strategy.oca.cancel`. This
way only one order is filled and the other one is cancelled. Here is the modified code:

```pine
//@version=5
strategy("Priced Entry demo")
var c = 0
if year > 2020
    c:= c + 1
if c == 1
    strategy.entry("LE1", strategy.long, 2, stop = high + 35 * syminfo.mintick, oca_type = strategy.oca.cancel)
    strategy.entry("LE2", strategy.long, 2, stop = high + 2 * syminfo.mintick, oca_type = strategy.oca.cancel)
```

If, for some reason, order placing conditions are not met when executing the command, the entry order will not be
placed. For example, if pyramiding settings are set to 2, the existing position already contains two entries and the
strategy tries to place a third one, it will not be placed. Entry conditions are evaluated at the order generation stage
and not at the execution stage. Therefore, if you submit two price type entries with pyramiding disabled, once one of

### Closing market position

Despite the fact that it is possible to exit from a specific entry in code, when orders are shown in the *List of Trades* in the *Strategy Tester* tab, they all are linked according to FIFO (first in, first out) rules. If an entry order ID is not specified for an exit order in code, the exit order closes the first entry order that opened market position. Let's study the following example:

```pinescript
//@version=5
strategy("exit Demo", pyramiding = 2, overlay = true)
if strategy.position_size == 0 and year > 2014
    strategy.entry("Buy1", strategy.long, 5)
else if strategy.position_size == 5
    strategy.entry("Buy2", strategy.long, 10, stop = strategy.position_avg_price + stra
else if strategy.position_size == 15
    strategy.exit("bracket", loss = 10, profit = 10)
```

The code given above places 2 orders sequentially: "Buy1" at market price and "Buy2" at a 10% higher price (stop order). The exit order is placed only after entry orders have been filled. If you apply the code to a chart, you will see that each entry order is closed by an exit order, though we did not specify entry order ID to close in this line::

```pinescript
strategy.exit("bracket", loss = 10, profit = 10)
```

Another example:

```pinescript
//@version=5
strategy("Exit Demo", pyramiding = 2, overlay = true)
if strategy.position_size == 0
    strategy.entry("Buy1", strategy.long, 5)
else if strategy.position_size == 5
    strategy.entry("Buy2", strategy.long, 10, stop = strategy.position_avg_price + stra
else if strategy.position_size == 15
    strategy.close("Buy2")
strategy.exit("bracket", "Buy1", loss = 10, profit = 10)
plot(strategy.position_avg_price)
```

*   It opens a 5-contract long position with the order "Buy1".
*   It extends the long position by purchasing 10 more contracts at 10% higher price with the order "Buy2".
*   The exit order (strategy.close) to sell 10 contracts (exit from "Buy2") is filled.

If you take a look at the plot, you can see that average entry price = "Buy2" execution price and our strategy closed exactly this entry order, while on the *Trade List* tab we can see that it closed the first "Buy1” order and half of the second "Buy2". It means that no matter which entry order you specify for your strategy to close, the broker emulator will still close the first one, according to FIFO rules. It works the same way as when trading with a real broker.

### OCA groups

It is possible to put orders in 2 different One-Cancells-All (OCA) groups in Pine Script™.

strategy.oca.cancel
As soon as an order from the group is filled (even partially) or cancelled, the other orders from the same group get cancelled. One should keep in mind that if order prices are the same or they are close, more than 1 order of the same group may be filled. This OCA group type is available only for entry orders because all exit orders are placed in `strategy.oca.reduce`.

Example:

```pine
//@version=5
strategy("oca cancel demo")
if year > 2014 and year < 2016
    strategy.entry("LE", strategy.long)
    strategy.entry("SE", strategy.short)
```

You may think that this is a reverse strategy since pyramiding is not allowed, but in fact both orders will get filled because they are market orders, which means they are to be executed immediately at the current price. The second order doesn't get cancelled because both are filled almost at the same moment and the system doesn't have time to process the first order fill and cancel the second one before it gets executed. The same would happen if these were price orders with same or similar prices. The strategy places all orders allowed according to market position, etc.

The strategy places all orders that do not contradict the rules (in our case market position is flat, therefore any entry order can be filled). At each tick calculation, firstly all orders with the satisfied conditions are executed and only then the orders from the group where an order was executed are cancelled.

To turn the above strategy into a reverse strategy you need to place orders in the OCA group:

```pine
//@version=5
strategy("oca_cancel demo")
if year > 2014 and year < 2016
    strategy.entry("LE", strategy.long, oca_type = strategy.oca.cancel, oca_name = "Entry")
    strategy.entry("SE", strategy.short, oca_type = strategy.oca.cancel, oca_name = "Entry")
```

strategy.oca.reduce
This group type allows multiple orders within the group to be filled. As one of the orders within the group starts to be filled, the size of other orders is reduced by the filled contracts amount. It is very useful for the exit strategies. Once the price touches your take-profit order and it is being filled, the stop-loss is not cancelled but its amount is reduced by the filled contracts amount, thus protecting the rest of the open position.

strategy.oca.none
The order is placed outside of the group (default value for the `strategy.order` and `strategy.entry` functions).

Every group has its own unique id, like orders. If two groups have the same id, but different type, they will be considered a different groups. Example:

```pine
//@version=5
strategy("My Script")
if year > 2014 and year < 2016
    strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long, oca_name = "My oca", oca_type = strategy.oca.reduce_size)
    strategy.exit("FromBuy", "Buy", profit = 100, loss = 200, oca_name = "My oca")
    strategy.entry("Sell", strategy.short, oca_name = "My oca", oca_type = strategy.oca.reduce_size)
    strategy.order("Order", strategy.short, oca_name = "My oca", oca_type = strategy.oca.none)
```

"Buy" and "Sell" will be placed in different groups as their type is different. "Order" will be outside of any group as its type is set to `strategy.oca.none`. Moreover, "Buy" will be placed in the exit group as exits are always placed in the `strategy.oca.reduce_size` type group.

## Risk management

It is not easy to create a universally profitable strategy. Usually, strategies are created for certain market patterns and can produce uncontrollable losses when applied to other data. Therefore, stopping auto trading when too many losses occur is important. A special group of strategy commands help you manage risk. They all start with the `strategy.risk.` prefix.

In any given strategy you can combine any number of risk management criteria in any combination. Every risk category command is calculated at every tick as well as at every order execution event, regardless of the `calc on order fills` strategy setting. There is no way to disable any risk rule at runtime from a script. Regardless of where in the script the risk rule is located it will always be applied unless the line with the rule is deleted and the script is recompiled.

When a risk management rule is triggered, no orders will be generated starting from the next calculation of the script. Therefore, if a strategy has several rules of the same type with different parameters, it will stop calculating when the rule with the most strict parameters is triggered. When a strategy is stopped, all unexecuted orders are cancelled and then a market order is sent to close the position if it is not flat.

Furthermore, it is worth remembering that when using resolutions higher than 1 day, the whole bar is considered to be 1 day for the rules starting with prefix `strategy.risk.max_intraday_`.

Example (MSFT, 1):

```pine
//@version=5
strategy("multi risk demo", overlay = true, pyramiding = 10, calc_on_order_fills = true)
if year > 2014
    strategy.entry("LE", strategy.long)
    strategy.risk.max_intraday_filled_orders(5)
    strategy.risk.max_intraday_filled_orders(2)
```

The position will be closed and trading will be stopped until the end of every trading session after two orders are executed within this session, as the second rule is triggered earlier and is valid until the end of the trading session.

One should remember that the `strategy.risk.allow_entry_in` rule is applied to entries only so it will be possible to enter in a trade using the `strategy.order` command, as this command is not an entry command per se. Moreover, when the `strategy.risk.allow_entry_in` rule is active, entries in a “prohibited trade” become exits instead of reverse trades.

Example (MSFT, 1D):

```pine
//@version=5
strategy("allow_entry_in demo", overlay = true)
if bar_index < 800
    if strategy.position_size <= 0
        strategy.entry("LE", strategy.long)
    else
        strategy.entry("SE", strategy.short)
strategy.risk.allow_entry_in(strategy.direction.long)
```

As short entries are prohibited by the risk rules, long exit trades will be made instead of reverse trades.

## Currency

TradingView strategies can operate in a currency that is different from the instrument's currency. *Net Profit* and *Open Profit* are recalculated in the account currency. Account currency is set in the strategy properties' *Base Currency* drop-down list or in the script via the `strategy(..., currency=currency.*)` parameter.

Performance report values are calculated in the selected currency.

Trade profit (open or closed) is calculated based on the profit in the instrument currency multiplied by the cross-rate on the close of the trading day previous to the bar where the strategy is calculated.

Example: we trade EURUSD, D and have selected `currency.EUR` as the strategy currency. Our strategy buys and exits the position using 1 point profit target or stop loss.

```pine
//@version=5
strategy("Currency test", currency = currency.EUR)
if bar index < 800
    strategy.entry("LE", strategy.long, 1000)
    strategy.exit("LX", "LE", profit = 1, loss = 1)
profit = strategy.netprofit
plot(math.abs((profit - profit[1])*100), "1 point profit", color = color.blue, linewidth = 2)
plot(1 / close[1], "prev usdeur", color = color.red)
```

After adding this strategy to the chart we can see that the plot lines are matching. This demonstrates that the rate to calculate the profit for every trade was based on the close of the previous day.

When trading on intra-day resolutions, the cross-rate on the close of the trading day previous to the bar where the strategy is calculated will be used and it will not change during the trading session.

When trading on resolutions higher than 1 day, the cross-rate on the close of the trading day previous to the close of the bar where the strategy is calculated will be used. Let's say we trade on a weekly chart, then the cross rate on Thursday's session close will always be used to calculate the profits.

In real-time, yesterday's session close rate is used.

### Margin

Margin for Long/Short positions (parameters: margin_long, margin_short) specifies the margin for each trade, i.e., the percent of the position that the trader must fund. For example, if the Margin for long positions is set to 25%, the trader has to have enough funds to cover 25% of the open trade and can potentially spend up to 400% of their equity on every trade.

If a trade has been opened and it starts losing money to the extent where the trader's funds are not enough to cover their portion of the trade, a Margin Call occurs and forcibly liquidates a part of the original position. The precise number of units that will be liquidated is 4 times the amount it takes to simply cover the loss. It is calculated via the following algorithm:

1. Calculate Money Spent, the amount of money the trader has spent on opening the position.

Position Size * Entry Price

2. Calculate the Market Value of Security (MVS).

Position Size * Current Price

3. Calculate the Open Profit. If the trade direction is short and Open Profit is a positive number, the result should still be negative, so we multiply the absolute value of our calculation by -1.

ABS(MVS - Money Spent) * -1

4. Calculate the Equity, i.e., the money available to the trader at the current moment.

Initial Capital + Net Profit + Open Profit

5. Convert Margin Percent to Margin Ratio.

Margin Percent / 100

6. Calculate Margin, i.e., the exact amount of money needed to cover their part of the open position.

MVS * Margin Ratio

7. Calculate Available Funds, i.e., the amount of lost money the trader cannot cover with their current equity.
Equity - Margin

8. Calculate the total amount of money the trader has lost.
Available Funds / Margin Ratio

9. Calculate how many units the trader would need to sell to cover the loss. The value is truncated to the same decimal point as the minimum contract size for the current symbol.
TRUNCATE(Step #8 / Current Price)

10. Calculate how many units the broker will sell to cover the loss. Our emulated broker sells 4 times as many units as necessary to make sure the margin call isn't constantly triggered if the losses continue. This value will be positive for short trades because the broker buys units to cover the loss instead of selling them.

Step #9 * 4

To examine this calculation in detail, let's add the built-in Supertrend Strategy to the NASDAQ:TSLA chart on the 1D timeframe. Set Order size to 300% of equity and Margin for long positions to 25%.



Our first entry happened on the opening of the bar on 16 Sep 2010. We buy 682438 units (Position size) for 4.43 USD (Entry price). Then, on 23 Sep 2010, when the price was at 3.9 (Current price), 111052 units were forcibly liquidated via margin call.

1. Money spent: 682438 * 4.43 = 3023200.34
2. MVS: 682438 * 3.9 = 2661508.2
3. Open Profit: -361692.14
4. Equity: 1000000 + 0 - 361692.14 = 638307.86
5. Margin Ratio: 25 / 100 = 0.25
6. Margin: 2661508.2 * 0.25 = 665377.05
7. Available Funds: 638307.86 - 665377.05 = -27069.19
8. Money Lost: -27069.19 / 0.25 = -108276.76
9. Shares to cover the loss: TRUNCATE(-108276.76 / 3.9) = TRUNCATE(-27763.27) = -27763
10. Margin Call Size: -27763 * 4 = - 111052

# Introduction

Tables are objects that can be used to position information in specific and fixed locations in a script's visual space.
Contrary to all other plots or objects drawn in Pine Script ™, tables are not anchored to specific bars; they float in a
script's space, whether in overlay or pane mode, in studies or strategies, independently of the chart bars being
viewed or the zoom factor used.

Tables contain cells arranged in columns and rows, much like a spreadsheet. They are created and populated in two
distincts steps:

1. A table's structure and key attributes are defined using `table.new()`, which returns a table ID that acts like a
pointer to the table, just like label, line, or array IDs do. The `table.new()` call will create the table object but
does not display it.
2. Once created, and for it to display, the table must be populated using one `table.cell()` call for each cell. Table
cells can contain text, or not. This second step is when the width and height of cells are defined.

Most attributes of a previously created table can be changed using `table.set_*()` setter functions. Attributes of
previously populated cells can be modified using `table.cell_set_*()` functions.

A table is positioned in an indicator's space by anchoring it to one of nine references: the four corners or midpoints,
including the center. Tables are positioned by expanding the table from its anchor, so a table anchored to the
`position.middle_right` reference will be drawn by expanding up, down and left from that anchor.

Two modes are available to determine the width/height of table cells:

- A default automatic mode calculates the width/height of cells in a column/row using the widest/highest text in
them.
- An explicit mode allows programmers to define the width/height of cells using a percentage of the indicator's
available x/y space.

Displayed table contents always represent the last state of the table, as it was drawn on the script's last execution,
on the dataset's last bar. Contrary to values displayed in the Data Window or in indicator values, variable contents
displayed in tables will thus not change as a script user moves his cursor over specific chart bars. For this reason, it is
strongly recommended to always restrict execution of all `table.*()` calls to either the first or last bars of the
dataset. Accordingly:

*   Use the `var` keyword to declare tables.
*   Enclose all other calls inside an `if barstate.islast` block.

Multiple tables can be used in one script, as long as they are each anchored to a different position. Each table
object is identified by its own ID. Limits on the quantity of cells in all tables are determined by the total number
of cells used in one script.

## Creating tables

When creating a table using `table.new()`, three parameters are mandatory: the table's position and its number of
columns and rows. Five other parameters are optional: the table's background color, the color and width of the
table's outer frame, and the color and width of the borders around all cells, excluding the outer frame. All table
attributes except its number of columns and rows can be modified using setter functions: `table.set_position()`,
`table.set_bgcolor()`, `table.set_frame_color()`, `table.set_frame_width()`, `table.set_border_color()` and
`table.set_border_width()`.

Tables can be deleted using `table.delete()`, and their content can be selectively removed using `table.clear()`.

When populating cells using `table.cell()`, you must supply an argument for four mandatory parameters: the table id
the cell belongs to, its column and row index using indices that start at zero, and the text string the cell contains,
which can be null. Seven other parameters are optional: the width and height of the cell, the text's attributes (color,
horizontal and vertical alignment, size), and the cell's background color. All cell attributes can be modified using
setter functions: `table.cell_set_text()`, `table.cell_set_width()`, `table.cell_set_height()`, `table.cell_set_text_color()`,
`table.cell_set_text_halign()`, `table.cell_set_text_valign()`, `table.cell_set_text_size()` and `table.cell_set_bgcolor()`.

Keep in mind that each successive call to `table.cell()` redefines all the cell's properties, deleting any properties set by
previous `table.cell()` calls on the same cell.

## Placing a single value in a fixed position

Let's create our first table, which will place the value of ATR in the upper-right corner of the chart. We first create a
one-cell table, then populate that cell:

```
//@version=5
indicator("ATR", "", true)
// We use `var` to only initialize the table on the first bar.
var table atrDisplay = table.new(position.top_right, 1, 1)
// We call `ta.atr()` outside the `if` block so it executes on each bar.
myAtr = ta.atr (14)
if barstate.islast
    // We only populate the table on the last bar.
    table.cell(atrDisplay, 0, 0, str.tostring(myAtr))
```

Note that:
*   We use the `var` keyword when creating the table with `table.new()`.
*   We populate the cell inside an `if barstate.islast` block using `table.cell()`.
*   When populating the cell, we do not specify the `width` or `height`. The width and height of our cell will thus adjust automatically to the text it contains.
*   We call `ta.atr(14)` prior to entry in our `if` block so that it evaluates on each bar. Had we used `str.tostring(ta.atr(14))` inside the `if` block, the function would not have evaluated correctly because it would be called on the dataset's last bar without having calculated the necessary values from the previous bars.

Let's improve the usability and aesthethics of our script:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("ATR", "", true)
atrPeriodInput = input.int(14, "ATR period", minval = 1, tooltip = "Using a period of
var table atrDisplay = table.new(position.top_right, 1, 1, bgcolor = color.gray, frame
myAtr = ta.atr(atrPeriodInput)
if barstate.islast
    table.cell(atrDisplay, 0, 0, str.tostring(myAtr, format.mintick), text_color = color
```

Note that:
*   We used `table.new()` to define a background color, a frame color and its width.
*   When populating the cell with `table.cell()`, we set the text to display in white.
*   We pass `format.mintick` as a second argument to the `str.tostring()` function to restrict the precision of ATR to the chart's tick precision.
*   We now use an input to allow the script user to specify the period of ATR. The input also includes a tooltip, which the user can see when he hovers over the "i" icon in the script's "Settings/Inputs" tab.

## Coloring the chart's background

This example uses a one-cell table to color the chart's background on the bull/bear state of RSI:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("Chart background", "", true)
bullColorInput = input.color(color.new(color.green, 95), "Bull", inline = "1")
bearColorInput = input.color(color.new(color.red, 95), "Bear", inline = "1")

// Function colors chart bg on RSI bull/bear state.
colorChartBg (bullColor, bearColor) =>
    var table bgTable = table.new(position.middle_center, 1, 1)
    float r = ta.rsi (close, 20)
    color bgColor = r> 50? bullColor : r < 50 ? bearColor : na
    if barstate.islast
        table.cell (bgTable, 0, 0, width = 100, height = 100, bgcolor = bgColor)

colorChartBg (bullColorInput, bearColorInput)
```

Note that:
* We provide users with inputs allowing them to specify the bull/bear colors to use for the background, and send those input colors as arguments to our `f_colorChartBg()` function.
* We create a new table only once, using the `var` keyword to declare the table.
* We use `table.cell()` on the last bar only, to specify the cell's properties. We make the cell the width and height of the indicator's space, so it covers the whole chart.

## Creating a display panel

Tables are ideal to create sophisticated display panels. Not only do they make it possible for display panels to always be visible in a constant position, they provide more flexible formatting because each cell's properties are controlled separately: background, text color, size and alignment, etc.

Here, we create a basic display panel showing a user-selected quantity of MAs values. We display their period in the first column, then their value with a green/red/gray background that varies with price's position with regards to each MA. When price is above/below the MA, the cell's background is colored with the bull/bear color. When the MA falls between the current bar's open and close, the cell's background is of the neutral color.

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("Price vs MA", "", true)

var string GP1 = "Moving averages"
int masQtyInput = input.int(20, "Quantity", minval = 1, maxval = 40, group = GP1)
int masStartInput = input.int(20, "Periods begin at", minval = 2, maxval = 200, group = GP1)
int masStepInput = input.int(20, "Periods increase by", minval = 1, maxval = 100, group = GP1)

var string GP2 = "Display"
string tableYposInput = input.string("top", "Panel position", inline = "11", options = ["top", "bottom"])
string tableXposInput = input.string("right", "", inline = "11", options = ["left", "right"])
color bullColorInput = input.color(color.new(color.green, 30), "Bull", inline = "12")
color bearColorInput = input.color(color.new(color.red, 30), "Bear", inline = "12")
color neutColorInput = input.color(color.new(color.gray, 30), "Neutral", inline = "12")

var table panel = table.new(tableYposInput + " " + tableXposInput, 2, masQtyInput + 1)

if barstate.islast
    // Table header.
    table.cell(panel, 0, 0, "MA", bgcolor = neutColorInput)
    table.cell(panel, 1, 0, "Value", bgcolor = neutColorInput)

int period = masStartInput
for i = 1 to masQtyInput
    // Call MAs on each bar.
    float ma = ta.sma(close, period)
    // Only execute table code on last bar.
    if barstate.islast
        // Period in left column.
        table.cell(panel, 0, i, str.tostring(period), bgcolor = neutColorInput)
        // If MA is between the open and close, use neutral color. If close is lower/higher than MA, use the appropriate color.
        bgColor = close > ma ? open < ma ? neutColorInput : bullColorInput : open > ma ? neutColorInput : bearColorInput
        // MA value in right column.
        table.cell(panel, 1, i, str.tostring(ma, format.mintick), text_color = color.black, bgcolor = bgColor)
    period += masStepInput
```

Note that:

*   Users can select the table's position from the inputs, as well as the bull/bear/neutral colors to be used for the background of the right column's cells.
*   The table's quantity of rows is determined using the number of MAs the user chooses to display. We add one row for the column headers.
*   Even though we populate the table cells on the last bar only, we need to execute the calls to `ta.sma()` on every bar so they produce the correct results. The compiler warning that appears when you compile the code can be safely ignored.
*   We separate our inputs in two sections using `group`, and join the relevant ones on the same line using `inline`. We supply tooltips to document the limits of certain fields using `tooltip`.

## Displaying a heatmap

Our next project is a heatmap, which will indicate the bull/bear relationship of the current price relative to its past values. To do so, we will use a table positioned at the bottom of the chart. We will display colors only, so our table will contain no text; we will simply color the background of its cells to produce our heatmap. The heatmap uses a user-selectable lookback period. It loops across that period to determine if price is above/below each bar in that past, and displays a progressively lighter intensity of the bull/bear color as we go further in the past:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("Price vs Past", "", true)

var int MAX_LOOKBACK = 300

int lookBackInput = input.int(150, minval = 1, maxval = MAX_LOOKBACK, step = 10)
color bullColorInput = input.color(#00FF00ff, "Bull", inline = "11")
color bearColorInput = input.color(#FF0080ff, "Bear", inline = "11")

// Function draws a heatmap showing the position of the current `src` relative t
drawHeatmap(src, lookBack) =>
    // float src : evaluated price series.
    // int lookBack: number of past bars evaluated.
    // Dependency: MAX LOOKBACK

    // Force historical buffer to a sufficient size.
    max_bars_back(src, MAX_LOOKBACK)
    // Only run table code on last bar.
    if barstate.islast
        var heatmap = table.new(position.bottom_center, lookBack, 1)
        for i = 1 to lookBackInput
            float transp = 100. * i / lookBack
            if src > src[i]
                table.cell(heatmap, lookBack - i, 0, bgcolor = color.new(bullColorInput, transp))
            else
                table.cell(heatmap, lookBack - i, 0, bgcolor = color.new(bearColorInput, transp))

drawHeatmap(high, lookBackInput)
```

Note that:

*   We define a maximum lookback period as a `MAX_LOOKBACK` constant. This is an important value and we use it for two purposes: to specify the number of columns we will create in our one-row table, and to specify the lookback period required for the `src` argument in our function, so that we force Pine Script™ to create a historical buffer size that will allow us to refer to the required quantity of past values of `src` in our `for` loop.
*   We offer users the possibility of configuring the bull/bear colors in the inputs and we use `inline` to place the color selections on the same line.
*   Inside our function, we enclose our table-creation code in an `if barstate.islast` construct so that it only runs on the last bar of the chart.
*   The initialization of the table is done inside the `if` statement. Because of that, and the fact that it uses the `var` keyword, initialization only occurs the first time the script executes on a last bar. Note that this behavior is different from the usual `var` declarations in the script's global scope, where initialization occurs on the first bar of the dataset, at `bar_index` zero.
*   We do not specify an argument to the `text` parameter in our `table.cell()` calls, so an empty string is used.
*   We calculate our transparency in such a way that the intensity of the colors decreases as we go further in history.
*   We use dynamic color generation to create different transparencies of our base colors as needed.
*   Contrary to other objects displayed in Pine scripts, this heatmap's cells are not linked to chart bars. The configured lookback period determines how many table cells the heatmap contains, and the heatmap will not change as the chart is panned horizontally, or scaled.
*   The maximum number of cells that can be displayed in the scritp's visual space will depend on your viewing device's resolution and the portion of the display used by your chart. Higher resolution screens and wider windows will allow more table cells to be displayed.

## Tips

• When creating tables in strategy scripts, keep in mind that unless the strategy uses `calc_on_every_tick = true`, table code enclosed in `if barstate.islast` blocks will not execute on each realtime update, so the table will not display as you expect.
• Keep in mind that successive calls to `table.cell()` overwrite the cell's properties specified by previous `table.cell()` calls. Use the setter functions to modify a cell's properties.
• Remember to control the execution of your table code wisely by restricting it to the necessary bars only. This saves server resources and your charts will display faster, so everybody wins.

- `plotshape()`

- Labels
  - Creating and modifying labels
  - Positioning labels
  - Reading label properties

  - Deleting labels

Introduction

You may display text or shapes using five different ways with Pine Script™:

- plotchar()
- plotshape()
- plotarrow()
- Labels created with `label.new()`
- Tables created with `table.new()` (see Tables)

Which one to use depends on your needs:

- Tables can display text in various relative positions on charts that will not move as users scroll of zoom the chart horizontally. Their content is not tethered to bars. In contrast, text displayed with `plotchar()`, `plotshape()` or `label.new()` is always tethered to a specific bar, so it will move with the bar's position on the chart. See the page on Tables for more information on them.
- Three function include are able to display pre-defined shapes: `plotshape()`, `plotarrow()` and Labels created with `label.new()`.
- `plotarrow()` cannot display text, only up or down arrows.
- `plotchar()` and `plotshape()` can display non-dynamic (not of "series" form) text on any bar or all bars of the chart.
- `plotchar()` can only display one character while `plotshape()` can display strings, including line breaks.
- `label.new()` can display a maximum of 500 labels on the chart. Its text can contain dynamic text, or “series strings". Line breaks are also supported in label text.
- While `plotchar()` and `plotshape()` can display text at a fixed offset in the past or the future, which cannot change during the script's execution, each `label.new()` call can use a "series” offset that can be calculated on the fly.

These are a few things to keep in mind concerning Pine Script ™ strings:
• Since the `text` parameter in both `plotchar()` and `plotshape()` require a "const string" argument, it cannot contain values such as prices that can only be known on the bar ("series string").
• To include “series” values in text displayed using `label.new()`, they will first need to be converted to strings using `str.tostring()`.
• The concatenation operator for strings in Pine Script™ is `+`. It is used to join string components into one string, e.g., `msg = "Chart symbol: " + syminfo.tickerid` (where `syminfo.tickerid` is a Pine Script™ built-in variable that returns the chart's exchange and symbol information in string format).
• Characters displayed by all these functions can be Unicode characters, which may include Unicode symbols. See this  script to get an idea of what can be done with Unicode characters.
• The color or size of text can sometimes be controlled using function parameters, but no inline formatting (bold, italics, monospace, etc.) is possible.
• Text from Pine scripts always displays on the chart in the Trebuchet MS font, which is used in many TradingView texts, including this one.

This script displays text using the four methods available in Pine Script ™:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("Four displays of text", overlay = true)
plotchar(ta.rising(close, 5), "`plotchar()`", "⬆️", location.belowbar, color.lime, size = size.small)
plotshape(ta.falling(close, 5), "`plotchar()`", location = location.abovebar, color = red, size = size.small)

if bar_index % 25 == 0
    label.new(bar_index, na, "LABEL•\nHigh = " + str.tostring(high, format.mintick) + "\nBars in the dataset" + str.tostring(barstate.isrealtime))

printTable(txt) => var table t = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1), table.cell(t, 0, 0, txt)
printTable("TABLE•\n" + str.tostring(bar_index + 1) + " bars\nin the dataset")
```

Note that:

• The method used to display each text string is shown with the text, except for the lime up arrows displayed using `plotchar()`, as it can only display one character.
• Label and table calls can be inserted in conditional structures to control when their are executed, whereas `plotchar()` and `plotshape()` cannot. Their conditional plotting must be controlled using their first argument, which is a "series bool" whose `true` or `false` value determines when the text is displayed.
• Numeric values displayed in the table and labels is first converted to a string using `str.tostring()`.
• We use the `+` operator to concatenate string components.
• `plotshape()` is designed to display a shape with accompanying text. Its `size` parameter controls the size of the shape, not of the text. We use `na` for its `color` argument so that the shape is not visible.
• Contrary to other texts, the table text will not move as you scroll or scale the chart.
• Some text strings contain the ⬆ Unicode arrow (U+1F807).
• Some text strings contain the `\n` sequence that represents a new line.

`plotchar()`

This function is useful to display a single character on bars. It has the following syntax:

`plotchar(series, title, char, location, color, offset, text, textcolor, editable, size)`

See the 
plotchar(bar_index, "Bar index", "", location.top)
```

Note that:

• The cursor is on the chart's last bar.
• The value of `bar_index` on that bar is displayed in indicator values (1) and in the Data Window (2).
• We use `location.top` because the default `location.abovebar` will put the price into play in the script's scale, which will often interfere with other plots.

`plotchar()` also works well to identify specific points on the chart or to validate that conditions are `true` when we expect them to be. This example displays an up arrow under bars where `close`, `high` and `volume` have all been rising for two bars:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
bool longSignal = ta.rising(close, 2) and ta.rising(high, 2) and (na(volume) or ta.rising(volume, 2))
plotchar(longSignal, "Long", "⬆", location.belowbar, color = na(volume) ? color.gray : color.green)
```

Note that:

*   We use `(na(volume) or ta.rising(volume, 2))` so our script will work on symbols without `volume` data. If we did not make provisions for when there is no `volume` data, which is what `na(volume)` does by being `true` when there is no volume, the `longSignal` variable's value would never be `true` because `ta.rising(volume, 2)` yields `false` in those cases.
*   We display the arrow in gray when there is no volume, to remind us that all three base conditions are not being met.
*   Because `plotchar()` is now displaying a character on the chart, we use `size = size.tiny` to control its size.
*   We have adapted the `location` argument to display the character under bars.

If you don't mind plotting only circles, you could also use `plot()` to achieve a similar effect:

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
longSignal = ta.rising(close, 2) and ta.rising(high, 2) and (na(volume) or ta.rising(volume, 2))
plot(longSignal ? low - ta.tr : na, "Long", color.blue, 2, plot.style_circles)
```

This method has the inconvenience that, since there is no relative positioning mechanism with `plot()` one must shift the circles down using something like `ta.tr` (the bar's "True Range"):

`plotshape()`

This function is useful to display pre-defined shapes and/or text on bars. It has the following syntax:

plotshape (series, title, style, location, color, offset, text, textcolor, editable, siz
See the  for details on its parameters.

Let's use the function to achieve more or less the same result as with our second example of the previous section:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
longSignal = ta.rising(close, 2) and ta.rising(high, 2) and (na(volume) or ta.rising(vo
plotshape(longSignal, "Long", shape.arrowup, location.belowbar)
```

Note that here, rather than using an arrow character, we are using the `shape.arrowup` argument for the `style` parameter.

It is possible to use different `plotshape()` calls to superimpose text on bars. You will need to use `\n` followed by a special non-printing character that doesn't get stripped out to preserve the newline's functionality. Here we're using a Unicode Zero-width space (U+200E). While you don't see it in the following code's strings, it is there and can be copy/pasted. The special Unicode character needs to be the last one in the string for text going up, and the first one when you are plotting under the bar and text is going down:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("Lift text", "", true)
plotshape(true, "", shape.arrowup, location.abovebar, color.green, text = "A")
plotshape(true, "", shape.arrowup, location.abovebar, color.lime, text = "B\n")
plotshape(true, "", shape.arrowdown, location.belowbar, color.red, text = "C")
plotshape(true, "", shape.arrowdown, location.belowbar, color.maroon, text = "\nD")
```

`plotarrow()`

The `plotarrow` function displays up or down arrows of variable length, based on the relative value of the series used in
the function's first argument. It has the following syntax:

`plotarrow(series, title, colorup, colordown, offset, minheight, maxheight, editable, sh`

See the ) for details on its parameters.
The `series` parameter in `plotarrow()` is not a “series bool" as in `plotchar()` and `plotshape()`; it is a "series int/float" and there's more to it than a simple `true` or `false` value determining when the arrows are plotted. This is the
logic governing how the argument supplied to `series` affects the behavior of `plotarrow()`:

*   `series > 0`: An up arrow is displayed, the length of which will be proportional to the relative value of the series on that bar in relation to other series values.
*   `series < 0`: A down arrow is displayed, proportionally-sized using the same rules.
*   `series == 0 or na(series)`: No arrow is displayed.

The maximum and minimum possible sizes for the arrows (in pixels) can be controlled using the `minheight` and `maxheight` parameters.

Here is a simple script illustrating how `plotarrow()` works:

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
body = close - open
plotarrow(body, colorup = color.teal, colordown = color.orange)
```



Note how the heigth of arrows is proportional to the relative size of the bar bodies.

You can use any series to plot the arrows. Here we use the value of the "Chaikin Oscillator” to control the location and size of the arrows:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Chaikin Oscillator Arrows", overlay = true)
fastLengthInput = input.int(3, minval = 1)
slowLengthInput = input.int(10, minval = 1)
osc = ta.ema(ta.accdist, fastLengthInput) - ta.ema(ta.accdist, slowLengthInput)
plotarrow(osc)
```

Note that we display the actual "Chaikin Oscillator" in a pane below the chart, so you can see what values are used to determine the position and size of the arrows.

# Labels

Labels are only available in v4 and higher versions of Pine Script™. They work very differently than `plotchar()` and `plotshape()`.

Labels are objects, like `lines and boxes`, or `tables`. Like them, they are referred to using an ID, which acts like a pointer. Label IDs are of "label" type. As with other Pine Script ™ objects, labels IDs are "time series" and all the functions used to manage them accept “series" arguments, which makes them very flexible.

**Note**

On TradingView charts, a complete set of Drawing Tools allows users to create and modify drawings using mouse actions. While they may sometimes look similar to drawing objects created with Pine Script ™ code, they are unrelated entities. Drawing objects created using Pine Script™ code cannot be modified with mouse actions, and hand-drawn drawings from the chart user interface are not visible from Pine scripts.

Labels are advantageous because:

*   They allow "series” values to be converted to text and placed on charts. This means they are ideal to display values that cannot be known before time, such as price values, support and resistance levels, of any other values that your script calculates.
*   Their positioning options are more flexible that those of the `plot*()` functions.
*   They offer more display modes.
*   Contrary to `plot*()` functions, label-handling functions can be inserted in conditional or loop structures, making it easier to control their behavior.
*   You can add tooltips to labels.

One drawback to using labels versus `plotchar()` and `plotshape()` is that you can only draw a limited quantity of them on the chart. The default is ~50, but you can use the `max_labels_count` parameter in your `indicator()` or `strategy()` declaration statement to specify up to 500. Labels, like `lines and boxes`, are managed using a garbage collection mechanism which deletes the oldest ones on the chart, such that only the most recently drawn labels are visible.

Your toolbox of built-ins to manage labels are all in the `label` namespace. They include:
* `label.new()` to create labels.
* `label.set_*()` functions to modify the properties of an existing label.
* `label.get_*()` functions to read the properties of an existing label.
* `label.delete()` to delete labels.
* The `label.all` array which always contains the IDs of all the visible labels on the chart. The array's size will depend on the maximum label count for your script and how many of those you have drawn. `aray.size(label.all)` will return the array's size.

## Creating and modifying labels

The `label.new()` function creates a new label. It has the following signature:

`label.new(x, y, text, xloc, yloc, color, style, textcolor, size, textalign, tooltip)`

The setter functions allowing you to change a label's properties are:
* `label.set_x()`
* `label.set_y()`
* `label.set_xy()`
* `label.set_text()`
* `label.set_xloc()`
* `label.set_yloc()`
* `label.set_color()`
* `label.set_style()`
* `label.set_textcolor()`
* `label.set_size()`
* `label.set_textalign()`
* `label.set_tooltip()`

They all have a similar signature. The one for `label.set_color()` is:

`label.set_color(id, color) => void`

where:
* `id` is the ID of the label whose property is to be modified.
* The next parameter is the property of the label to modify. It depends on the setter function used. `label.set_xy()` changes two properties, so it has two such parameters.

This is how you can create labels in their simplest form:

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
label.new(bar_index, high)
```

Note that:

• The label is created with the parameters `x = bar_index` (the index of the current bar, `bar_index`) and
`Y = high` (the bar's `high` value).
• We do not supply an argument for the function's `text` parameter. Its default value being an empty string, no
text is displayed.
• No logic controls our `label.new()` call, so labels are created on every bar.
• Only the last 54 labels are displayed because our `indicator()` call does not use the `max_labels_count`
parameter to specify a value other than the ~50 default.
• Labels persist on bars until your script deletes them using `label.delete()`, or garbage collection removes them.

In the next example we display a label on the bar with the highest `high` value in the last 50 bars:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)

// Find the highest `high` in last 50 bars and its offset. Change it's sign so it is positive.
LOOKBACK = 50
hi = ta.highest(LOOKBACK)
highestBarOffset = - ta.highestbars(LOOKBACK)

// Create label on bar zero only.
var lbl = label.new(na, na, "", color = color.orange, style = label.style_label_lower_left)
// When a new high is found, move the label there and update its text and tooltip.
if ta.change (hi)
    // Build label and tooltip strings.
    labelText = "High: " + str.tostring(hi, format.mintick)
    tooltipText = "Offest in bars: " + str.tostring (highestBarOffset) + "\nLow: " + str.tostring (highestBarOffset)

    // Update the label's position, text and tooltip.
    label.set_xy(lbl, bar_index [highestBarOffset], hi)
    label.set text(lbl, labelText)
    label.set_tooltip (lbl, tooltipText)
```

Note that:

• We create the label on the first bar only by using the `var` keyword to declare the `lbl` variable that contains the label's ID. The `x`, `y` and `text` arguments in that `label.new()` call are irrelevant, as the label will be updated on further bars. We do, however, take care to use the `color` and `style` we want for the labels, so they don't need updating later.
• On every bar, we detect if a new high was found by testing for changes in the value of `hi`
• When a change in the high value occurs, we update our label with new information. To do this, we use three `label.set*()` calls to change the label's relevant information. We refer to our label using the `lbl` variable, which contains our label's ID. The script is thus maintaining the same label throughout all bars, but moving it and updating its information when a new high is detected.

Here we create a label on each bar, but we set its properties conditionally, depending on the bar's polarity:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
lbl = label.new(bar_index, na)
if close >= open
    label.set_text( lbl, "green")
    label.set_color(lbl, color.green)
    label.set_yloc( lbl, yloc.belowbar)
    label.set_style(lbl, label.style_label_up)
else
    label.set_text ( lbl, "red")
    label.set_color(lbl, color.red)
    label.set_yloc( lbl, yloc.abovebar)
    label.set_style(lbl, label.style_label_down)
```

# Positioning labels

Labels are positioned on the chart according to x (bars) and y (price) coordinates. Five parameters affect this behavior: x, y, xloc, yloc and style:

**x**

Is either a bar index or a time value. When a bar index is used, the value can be offset in the past or in the future (maximum of 500 bars in the future). Past or future offsets can also be calculated when using time values. The x value of an existing label can be modified using `label.set_x()` or `label.set_xy()`.

**xloc**

Is either `xloc.bar_index` (the default) or `xloc.bar_time`. It determines which type of argument must be used with x. With `xloc.bar_index`, x must be an absolute bar index. With `xloc.bar_time`, x must be a UNIX time in milliseconds corresponding to the time value of a bar's open. The `xloc` value of an existing label can be modified using `label.set_xloc()`.

**y**

Is the price level where the label is positioned. It is only taken into account with the default `yloc` value of `yloc.price`. If `yloc` is `yloc.abovebar` or `yloc.belowbar` then the y argument is ignored. The y value of an existing label can be modified using `label.set_y()` or `label.set_xy()`.

**yloc**

Can be `yloc.price` (the default), `yloc.abovebar` or `yloc.belowbar`. The argument used for y is only taken into account with `yloc.price`. The `yloc` value of an existing label can be modified using `label.set_yloc()`.

**style**

The argument used has an impact on the visual appearance of the label and on its position relative to the reference point determined by either the y value or the top/bottom of the bar when `yloc.abovebar` or `yloc.belowbar` are used. The style of an existing label can be modified using `label.set_style()`.

These are the available `style` arguments:

| Argument                   | Label | Label with text | Argument                      | Label | Label with text |
|----------------------------|-------|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------|-----------------|
| `label.style_xcross`       | ❌     | text            | `label.style_label_up`        | 🗐     | text            |
| `label.style_cross`        | +     | + text        | `label.style_label_down`      | 🗐     | text            |

| `label.style_triangledown` | ▼     | text            | `label.style_label_upper_right` | 🗐     | Text            |
| `label.style_arrowup`      | ⬆     | text            | `label.style_label_center`    | 🗐     | Tex             |
| `label.style_arrowdown`    | ⬇     | text            | `label.style_none`            |       | tex             |

When using `xloc.bar_time`, the x value must be a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds. See the page on  for more
information. The start time of the current bar can be obtained from the `time` built-in variable. The bar time of
previous bars is `time[1]`, `time[2]` and so on. Time can also be set to an absolute value with the 
function. You may add or subtract periods of time to achieve relative time offset.

Let's position a label one day ago from the date on the last bar:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("")
daysAgoInput = input.int(1, tooltip = "Use negative values to offset in the future")
if barstate.islast
    MS_IN_ONE_DAY = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
    oneDayAgo = time - (daysAgoInput * MS_IN_ONE_DAY)
    label.new(oneDayAgo, high, xloc = xloc.bar_time, style = label.style_label_right)
```

Note that because of varying time gaps and missing bars when markets are closed, the positioning of the label may not always be exact. Time offsets of the sort tend to be more reliable on 24x7 markets.

You can also offset using a bar index for the `x` value, e.g.:

```
label.new(bar_index + 10, high)
label.new(bar_index - 10, high[10])
label.new(bar_index[10], high[10])
```

## Reading label properties

The following *getter* functions are available for labels:

*   `label.get_x()`
*   `label.get_y()`
*   `label.get_text()`

They all have a similar signature. The one for `label.get_text()` is:

```
label.get_text(id) → series string
```

where `id` is the label whose text is to be retrieved.

## Cloning labels

The `label.copy()` function is used to clone labels. Its syntax is:

```
label.copy(id) → void
```

## Deleting labels

The `label.delete()` function is used to delete labels. Its syntax is:

```
label.delete(id) → void
```

To keep only a user-defined quantity of labels on the chart, one could use code like this:

```
//@version=5
MAX_LABELS = 500
indicator("", max_labels_count = MAX_LABELS)
qtyLabelsInput = input.int(5, "Labels to keep", minval = 0, maxval = MAX_LABELS)
myRSI = ta.rsi(close, 20)
if myRSI > ta.highest(myRSI, 20)[1]
    label.new(bar_index, myRSI, str.tostring(myRSI, "%2.00"), style = label.style_none)
if array.size(label.all) > qtyLabelsInput
    label.delete(array.get(label.all, 0))
plot(myRSI)
```

Note that:

*   We define a `MAX_LABELS` constant to hold the maximum quantity of labels a script can accommodate. We use that value to set the `max_labels_count` parameter's value in our `indicator()` call, and also as the `maxval` value in our `input.int()` call to cap the user value.

*   We create a new label when our RSI breaches its highest value of the last 20 bars. Note the offset of `[1]` we use in `if myRSI > ta.highest(myRSI, 20)[1]`. This is necessary. Without it, the value returned by `ta.highest()` would always include the current value of `myRSI`, so `myRSI` would never be higher than the function's return value.

*   After that, we delete the oldest label in the `label.all` array that is automatically maintained by the Pine Script™ runtime and contains the ID of all the visible labels drawn by our script. We use the `array.get()` function to retrieve the array element at index zero (the oldest visible label ID). We then use `label.delete()` to delete the label linked with that ID.

Note that if one wants to position a label on the last bar only, it is unnecessary and inefficent to create and delete the label as the script executes on all bars, so that only the last label remains:

```
// INEFFICENT!
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
lbl = label.new(bar_index, high, str.tostring(high, format.mintick))
label.delete(lbl[1])
```

This is the efficient way to realize the same task:

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
if barstate.islast
    // Create the label once, the first time the block executes on the last bar.
    var lbl = label.new(na, na)
    // On all iterations of the script on the last bar, update the label's information.
    label.set_xy(lbl, bar_index, high)
    label.set_text(lbl, str.tostring(high, format.mintick))
```

## Realtime behavior

Labels are subject to both commit and rollback actions, which affect the behavior of a script when it executes in the realtime bar. See the page on Pine Script™'s Execution model.

This script demonstrates the effect of rollback when running in the realtime bar:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
`label.new`(bar_index, high)
```

On realtime bars, `label.new()` creates a new label on every script update, but because of the rollback process, the label created on the previous update on the same bar is deleted. Only the last label created before the realtime bar's close will be committed, and thus persist.

# Introduction

# Four references

Four different references come into play when using date and time values in Pine Script ™:

1.  UTC time zone: The native format for time values in Pine Script ™ is the Unix time in milliseconds. Unix time is the time elapsed since the Unix Epoch on January 1st, 1970. See here for the current Unix time in seconds and here for more information on Unix Time. A value for the Unix time is called a timestamp. Unix timestamps are always expressed in the UTC (or “GMT", or "GMT+0”) time zone. They are measured from a fixed reference, i.e., the Unix Epoch, and do not vary with time zones. Some Pine Script ™ built-ins use the UTC time zone as a reference.
2.  Exchange time zone: A second time-related key reference for traders is the time zone of the exchange where an instrument is traded. Some built-ins like hour return values in the exchange's time zone by default.
3.  `timezone` parameter: Some functions that normally return values in the exchange's time zone, such as `hour()` include a `timezone` parameter that allows you to adapt the function's result to another time zone. Other functions like `time()` include both `session` and `timezone` parameters. In those cases, the `timezone` argument applies to how the `session` argument is interpreted — not to the time value returned by the function.
4. Chart's time zone: This is the time zone chosen by the user from the chart using the "Chart
Settings/Symbol/Time Zone” field. This setting only affects the display of dates and times on the chart. It does
not affect the behavior of Pine scripts, and they have no visibility over this setting.

When discussing variables or functions, we will note if they return dates or times in UTC or exchange time zone.
Scripts do not have visibility on the user's time zone setting on his chart.

## Time built-ins

Pine Script ™ has built-in variables to:
* Get timestamp information from the current bar (UTC time zone): `time` and `time_close`
* Get timestamp information for the beginning of the current trading day (UTC time zone): `time_tradingday`
* Get the current time in one-second increments (UTC time zone): `timenow`
* Retrieve calendar and time values from the bar (exchange time zone): `year`, `month`, `weekofyear`, `dayofmonth`,
`dayofweek`, `hour`, `minute` and `second`
* Return the time zone of the exchange of the chart's symbol with `syminfo.timezone`

There are also built-in functions that can:
* Return timestamps of bars from other timeframes with `time()` and `time_close()`, without the need for a
`request.security()` call
* Retrieve calendar and time values from any timestamp, which can be offset with a time zone: `year()`, `month()`,
`weekofyear()`, `dayofmonth()`, `dayofweek()`, `hour()`, `minute()` and `second()`
* Create a timestamp using `timestamp()`
* Convert a timestamp to a formatted date/time string for display, using `str.format()`
* Input data and time values. See the section on Inputs.
* Work with session information.

## Time zones

TradingViewers can change the time zone used to display bar times on their charts. Pine scripts have no visibility over
this setting. While there is a `syminfo.timezone` variable to return the time zone of the exchange where the chart's
instrument is traded, there is no `chart.timezone` equivalent.

When displaying times on the chart, this shows one way of providing users a way of adjusting your script's time values
to those of their chart. This way, your displayed times can match the time zone used by traders on their chart:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Time zone control")
MS_IN_1H = 1000 * 60 * 60
TOOLTIP01 = "Enter your time zone's offset (+ or -), including a decimal fraction if ne
hoursOffsetInput = input.float(0.0, "Timezone offset (in hours)", minval = -12.0, maxva

printTable (txt) =>
    var table t = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1)
    table.cell(t, 0, 0, txt, text_halign = text.align_right, bgcolor = color.yellow)

msOffsetInput = hoursOffsetInput * MS_IN_1H
printTable (
  str.format("Last bar''s open time UTC: {0,date,HH:mm:ss yyyy.MM.dd}", time) +
  str.format("\nLast bar''s close time UTC: {0,date,HH:mm:ss yyyy.MM.dd}", time_close) +
  str.format("\n\nLast bar''s open time EXCHANGE: {0,date,HH:mm:ss yyyy.MM.dd}", time(t
  str.format("\nLast bar''s close time EXCHANGE: {0,date,HH:mm:ss yyyy.MM.dd}", time_cl
  str.format("\n\nLast bar''s open time OFFSET ({0}): {1,date, HH:mm:ss yyyy.MM.dd}", ho
  str.format("\nLast bar''s close time OFFSET ({0}): {1,date, HH:mm:ss yyyy.MM.dd}", hou
  str.format("\n\nCurrent time OFFSET ({0}): {1,date,HH:mm:ss yyyy.MM.dd}", hoursOffset
)
```

Note that:

*   We convert the user offset expressed in hours to milliseconds with `msOffsetInput`. We then add that offset to a timestamp in UTC format before converting it to display format, e.g., `time + msOffsetInput` and `timenow + msOffsetInput`.
*   We use a tooltip to provide instructions to users.
*   We provide `minval` and `maxval` values to protect the input field, and a `step` value of 0.5 so that when they use the field's up/down arrows, they can intuitively figure out that fractions can be used.
*   The `str.format()` function formats our time values, namely the last bar's time and the current time.

Some functions that normally return values in the exchange's time zone provide means to adapt their result to another time zone through the `timezone` parameter. This script illustrates how to do this with `hour()`:

```
//@version=5
indicator('`hour(time, "GMT+0")` in orange')
color BLUE_LIGHT = #0000FF30
plot(hour, "", BLUE_LIGHT, 8)
plot(hour(time, syminfo.timezone))
plot(hour(time, "GMT+0"),"UTC", color.orange)
```

Note that:

*   The `hour` variable and the `hour()` function normally returns a value in the exchange's time zone. Accordingly,

# Time zone strings

The argument used for the `timezone` parameter in functions such as `time()`, `timestamp()`, `hour()`, etc., can be in different formats, which you can find in the  reference page. Contents from the "TZ database name”, “UTC offset ±hh:mm" and "UTC DST offset ±hh:mm" columns of that page's table can be used.

To express an offset of +5.5 hours from UTC, these strings found in the reference page are all equivalent:

- `"GMT+05:30"`
- `"Asia/Calcutta"`
- `"Asia/Colombo"`
- `"Asia/Kolkata"`

Non-fractional offsets can be expressed in the `"GMT+5"` form. `"GMT+5.5"` is not allowed.

# Time variables

`time` and `time_close`

Let's start by plotting `time` and `time_close`, the Unix timestamp in milliseconds of the bar's opening and closing time:



```pine
//@version=5
indicator("`time` and `time_close` values on bars")
plot(time, "`time`")
plot(time_close, "`time_close`")
```

Note that:

- The `time` and `time_close` variables returns a timestamp in , which is independent of the timezone selected by the user on his chart. In this case, the chart's time zone setting is the exchange time zone, so whatever symbol is on the chart, its exchange time zone will be used to display the date and time values on the chart's cursor. The NASDAQ's time zone is UTC-4, but this only affects the chart's display of date/time values; it does not impact the values plotted by the script.
- The last `time` value for the plot shown in the scale is the number of milliseconds elapsed from 00:00:00 UTC, 1
January, 1970, until the bar's opening time. It corresponds to 17:30 on the 27th of September 2021. However,
because the chart uses the UTC-4 time zone (the NASDAQ's time zone), it displays the 13:30 time, four hours
earlier than UTC time.
• The difference between the two values on the last bar is the number of milliseconds in one hour (1000 * 60 * 60
= 3,600,000) because we are on a 1H chart.

`time_tradingday`
time_tradingday is useful when a symbol trades on overnight sessions that start and close on different calendar days.
For example, this happens in forex markets where a session can open Sunday at 17:00 and close Monday at 17:00.

The variable returns the time of the beginning of the trading day in UNIX time when used at timeframes of 1D and
less. When used on timeframes higher than 1D, it returns the starting time of the last trading day in the bar (e.g., at
1W, it will return the starting time of the last trading day of the week).

`timenow`
timenow returns the current time in UNIX time. It works in realtime, but also when a script executes on historical
bars. In realtime, your scripts will only perceive changes when they execute on feed updates. When no updates occur,
the script is idle, so it cannot update its display. See the page on Pine Script ™'s execution model for more
information.

This script uses the values of timenow and time_close to calculate a realtime countdown for intraday bars. Contrary
to the countdown on the chart, this one will only update when a feed update causes the script to execute another
iteration:

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)

printTable(txt) =>
    var table t = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1)
    table.cell(t, 0, 0, txt, text_halign = text.align_right, bgcolor = color.yellow)

printTable(str.format("{0,time,HH:mm:ss.SSS}", time_close - timenow))
```

Calendar dates and times
Calendar date and time variables such as year, month, weekofyear, dayofmonth, dayofweek, hour, minute and second
can be useful to test for specific dates or times, and as arguments to timestamp().

When testing for specific dates or times, ones needs to account for the possibility that the script will be executing on
timeframes where the tested condition cannot be detected, or for cases where a bar with the specific requirement
will not exist. Suppose, for example, we wanted to detect the first trading day of the month. This script shows how
using only dayofmonth will not work when a weekly chart is used or when no trading occurs on the 1st of the month:

AAPL

Trading Publish
USD
156.00
154.00
152.53
150.00
148.00
146.92
146.00
144.00
142.00
140.00

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
firstDayIncorrect = dayofmonth == 1
firstDay = ta.change(time("M"))
plotchar(firstDayIncorrect, "firstDayIncorrect", ".", location.top, size = size.small)
bgcolor(firstDay? color.silver: na)
```

Note that:

*   Using `ta.change(time("M"))` is more robust as it works on all months (#1 and #2), displayed as the silver background, whereas the blue dot detected using `dayofmonth == 1` does not work (#1) when the first trading day of September occurs on the 2nd.

*   The `dayofmonth == 1` condition will be `true` on all intrabars of the first day of the month, but `ta.change(time("M"))` will only be `true` on the first.

If you wanted your script to only display for years 2020 and later, you could use:

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
plot(year >= 2020 ? close: na, linewidth = 3)
```

`syminfo.timezone()`

`syminfo.timezone` returns the time zone of the chart symbol's exchange. It can be helpful when a `timezone` parameter is available in a function, and you want to mention that you are using the exchange's timezone explicitly. It is usually redundant because when no argument is supplied to `timezone`, the exchange's time zone is assumed.

Time functions

`time()` and `time_close()`

The `time()` and `time_close()` functions have the following signature:

```
time(timeframe, session, timezone) series int
time_close(timeframe, session, timezone) series int
```

They accept three arguments:
timeframe
A string in timeframe.period format.
session
An optional string in session specification format: "hhmm-hhmm[:days]", where the [days] part is optional.
See the page on sessions for more information.
timezone
An optional value that qualifies the argument for session when one is used.
See the time() and time_close() entries in the Reference Manual for more information.
The time() function is most often used to:
1. Test if a bar is in a specific time period, which will require using the session parameter. In those cases,
timeframe.period, i.e., the chart's timeframe, will often be used for the first parameter. When using the
function this way, we rely on the fact that it will return na when the bar is not part of the period specified in
the session argument.
2. Detecting changes in higher timeframes than the chart's by using the higher timeframe for the timeframe
argument. When using the function for this purpose, we are looking for changes in the returned value, which
means the higher timeframe bar has changed. This will usually require using ta.change() to test, e.g.,
ta.change(time("D")) will return the change in time when a new higher timeframe bar comes in, so the
expression's result will cast to a “bool” value when used in a conditional expression. The “bool” result will be
true when there is a change and false when there is no change.
Testing for sessions
Let's look at an example of the first case where we want to determine if a bar's starting time is part of a period
between 11:00 and 13:00:
```
//@version=5
indicator("Session bars", "", true)
inSession = not na(time(timeframe.period, "1100-1300"))
bgcolor(inSession ? color.silver: na)
```
Note that:
• We use time(timeframe.period, "1100-1300"), which says: "Check the chart's timeframe if the current
bar's opening time is between 11:00 and 13:00 inclusively". The function returns its opening time if the bar is in
the session. If it is not, the function returns `na`.
* We are interested in identifying the instances when `time()` does not return `na` because that means the bar is in
the session, so we test for `not na(...)`. We do not use the actual return value of `time()` when it is not `na`; we
are only interested in whether it returns `na` or not.

Testing for changes in higher timeframes

It is often helpful to detect changes in a higher timeframe. For example, you may want to detect trading day changes
while on intraday charts. For these cases, you can use the fact that `time("D")` returns the opening time of the 1D
bar, even if the chart is at an intraday timeframe such as 1H:

![Chart showing changes in higher timeframes]

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)
bool newDay = ta.change(time("D"))
bgcolor(newDay ? color.silver : na)

newExchangeDay = ta.change(dayofmonth)
plotchar(newExchangeDay, "newExchange Day", "AA", location.top, size = size.small)
```

Note that:
* The `newDay` variable detects changes in the opening time of 1D bars, so it follows the conventions for the
chart's symbol, which uses overnight sessions of 17:00 to 17:00. It changes values when a new session comes in.
* Because `newExchangeDay` detects change in `dayofmonth` in the calendar day, it changes when the day
changes on the chart.
* The two change detection methods only coincide on the chart when there are days without trading. On Sundays
here, for example, both detection methods will detect a change because the calendar day changes from the last
trading day (Friday) to the first calendar day of the new week, Sunday, which is when Monday's overnight
session begins at 17:00.

Calendar dates and times

Calendar date and time functions such as `year()`, `month()`, `weekofyear()`, `dayofmonth()`, `dayofweek()`, `hour()`, `minute()`
and `second()` can be useful to test for specific dates or times. They all have signatures similar to the ones shown here
for `dayofmonth()`:

```
dayofmonth(time) => series int
dayofmonth(time, timezone) => series int
```

This will plot the day of the opening of the bar where the January 1st, 2021 at 00:00 time falls between its time and
time_close values:

```
//@version=5
indicator("")
exchangeDay = dayofmonth(timestamp("2021-01-01"))
plot(exchangeDay)
```

The value will be the 31st or the 1st, depending on the calendar day of when the session opens on the chart's symbol.
The date for symbols traded 24x7 at exchanges using the UTC time zone will be the 1st. For symbols trading on
exchanges at UTC-4, the date will be the 31st.

`timestamp()`

The `timestamp()` function has a few different signatures:

```
timestamp(year, month, day, hour, minute, second) -> simple/series int
timestamp(timezone, year, month, day, hour, minute, second) -> simple/series int
timestamp(dateString) -> const int
```

The only difference between the first two is the `timezone` parameter. Its default value is `syminfo.timezone`. See
the Time zone strings section of this page for valid values.

The third form is used as a `defval` value in `input.time()`. See the `timestamp()` entry in the Reference Manual for
more information.

`timestamp()` is useful to generate a timestamp for a specific date. To generate a timestamp for Jan 1, 2021, use
either one of these methods:

```
//@version=5
indicator("")
yearBeginning1 = timestamp("2021-01-01")
yearBeginning2 = timestamp (2021, 1, 1, 0, 0)
printTable(txt) => var table t = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1), table.cell(t,
printTable(str.format("yearBeginning1: {0,date,yyyy.MM.dd hh:mm}\nyearBeginning2: {1,da
```

You can use offsets in `timestamp()` arguments. Here, we subtract 2 from the value supplied for its `day` parameter to
get the date/time from the chart's last bar two days ago. Note that because of different bar alignments on various
instruments, the bar identified on the chart may not always be exactly 48 hours away, although the function's return
value is correct:

```
//@version=5
indicator("")
twoDaysAgo = timestamp(year, month, dayofmonth - 2, hour, minute)
printTable(txt) => var table t = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1), table.cell(t,
printTable(str.format("{0,date,yyyy.MM.dd hh:mm}", twoDaysAgo))
```

Formatting dates and time

Timestamps can be formatted using `str.format()`. These are examples of various formats:

LTCUSD

Litecoin / U.S. Dollar 1D COINBASE

# Timeframes

*   
*   
*   

## Introduction

The *timeframe* of a chart is sometimes also referred to as its *interval* or *resolution*. It is the unit of time represented by one bar on the chart. All standard chart types use a timeframe: "Bars", "Candles", "Hollow Candles", "Line", "Area" and "Baseline". One non-standard chart type also uses timeframes: "Heikin Ashi".

Programmers interested in accessing data from multiple timeframes will need to become familiar with how timeframes are expressed in Pine Script™, and how to use them.

Timeframe strings come into play in different contexts:

*   They must be used in `request.security()` when requesting data from another symbol and/or timeframe. See the page on  to explore the use of `request.security()`.
*   They can be used as an argument to `time()` and `time_close()` functions, to return the time of a higher timeframe bar. This, in turn, can be used to detect changes in higher timeframes from the chart's timeframe without using `request.security()`. See the  section to see how to do this.
*   The `input.timeframe()` function provides a way to allow script users to define a timeframe through a script's "Inputs" tab (see the  section for more information).
*   The `indicator()` declaration statement has an optional `timeframe` parameter that can be used to provide multi-timeframe capabilities to simple scripts without using `request.security()`.
*   Many built-in variables provide information on the timeframe used by the chart the script is running on. See the  section for more information on them, including `timeframe.period` which returns a string in Pine Script™'s timeframe specification format.

## Timeframe string specifications

Timeframe strings follow these rules:

*   They are composed of the multiplier and the timeframe unit, e.g., “1S”, “30” (30 minutes), "1D" (one day), "3M" (three months).
*   The unit is represented by a single letter, with no letter used for minutes: “S” for seconds, “D” for days, "W" for weeks and "M" for months.
*   When no multiplier is used, 1 is assumed: "S" is equivalent to "1S”, “D” to “1D, etc. If only "1" is used, it is interpreted as "1min", since no unit letter identifier is used for minutes.
*   There is no "hour" unit; "1H" is **not** valid. The correct format for one hour is "60" (remember no unit letter is specified for minutes).
*   The valid multipliers vary for each timeframe unit:
    *   For seconds, only the discrete 1, 5, 10, 15 and 30 multipliers are valid.
    *   For minutes, 1 to 1440.
    *   For days, 1 to 365.
    *   For weeks, 1 to 52.
    *   For months, 1 to 12.

## Comparing timeframes

It can be useful to compare different timeframe strings to determine, for example, if the timeframe used on the chart is lower than the higher timeframes used in the script, as using timeframes lower than the chart is usually not a good idea. See the  section for more information on the subject.

Converting timeframe strings to a representation in fractional minutes provides a way to compare them using a universal unit. This script uses the `timeframe.in_seconds()` function to convert a timeframe into float seconds and then converts the result into minutes:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Timeframe in minutes example", "", true)
string tfInput = input.timeframe (defval = "", title = "Input TF")
float chartTFInMinutes = timeframe.in_seconds() / 60
float inputTFInMinutes = timeframe.in_seconds (tfInput) / 60

var table t = table.new(position.top_right, 1, 1)
string txt = "Chart TF: " + str.tostring(chartTFInMinutes, "#.### minutes") +
"\nInput TF: " + str.tostring(inputTFInMinutes, "#.### minutes")
if barstate.isfirst
table.cell(t, 0, 0, txt, bgcolor = color.yellow)
else if barstate.islast
table.cell_set_text(t, 0, 0, txt)

if chartTFInMinutes > inputTFInMinutes
    runtime.error("The chart's timeframe must not be higher than the input's timeframe.")
```

Note that:

*   We use the built-in `timeframe.in_seconds()` function to convert the chart and the `input.timeframe()` function into seconds, then divide by 60 to convert into minutes.
*   We use two calls to the `timeframe.in_seconds()` function in the initialization of the `chartTFInMinutes` and `inputTFInMinutes` variables. In the first instance, we do not supply an argument for its `timeframe` parameter, so the function returns the chart's timeframe in seconds. In the second call, we supply the timeframe selected by the script's user through the call to `input.timeframe()`.
*   Next, we validate the timeframes to ensure that the input timeframe is equal to or higher than the chart's timeframe. If it is not, we generate a runtime error.
*   We finally print the two timeframe values converted to minutes.

Introduction

This style guide provides recommendations on how to name variables and organize your Pine scripts in a standard way that works well. Scripts that follow our best practices will be easier to read, understand and maintain.

You can see scripts using these guidelines published from the  and  accounts on the platform.

Naming Conventions

We recommend the use of:

*   `camelCase` for all identifiers, i.e., variable or function names: `ma`, `maFast`, `maLengthInput`, `maColor`, `roundedOHLC()`, `pivotHi()`.
*   All caps `SNAKE_CASE` for constants: `BULL_COLOR`, `BEAR_COLOR`, `MAX_LOOKBACK`.
*   The use of qualifying suffixes when it provides valuable clues about the type or provenance of a variable: `maShowInput`, `bearColor`, `bearColorInput`, `volumesArray`, `maPlotID`, `resultsTable`, `levelsColorArray`.

# Script organization

The Pine Script™ compiler is quite forgiving of the positioning of specific statements or the version  in the script. While other arrangements are syntactically correct, this is how we recommend organizing scripts:

```
<license>
<version>
<declaration_statement>
<import_statements>
<constant declarations>
<inputs>
<function_declarations>
<calculations>
<strategy_calls>
<visuals>
<alerts>
```

## <license>

If you publish your open-source scripts publicly on TradingView (scripts can also be published privately), your open-source code is by default protected by the Mozilla license. You may choose any other license you prefer.

The reuse of code from those scripts is governed by our  which preempt the author's license.

The standard license comments appearing at the beginning of scripts are:

```
// This source code is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License 2.0 at https:
//
username
```

## <version>

This is the  defining the version of Pine Script™ the script will use. If none is present, v1 is used. For v5, use:

```
//@version=5
```

## <declaration_statement>

This is the mandatory declaration statement which defines the type of your script. It must be a call to either `indicator()`, `strategy()`, or `library()`.

## <import_statements>

If your script uses one or more Pine Script™ libraries, your `import` statements belong here.

## <constant_declarations>

While there is a "constant" form in Pine Script™, there is no formal "constant" type. We nonetheless use "constant" to denote variables of any type meeting these criteria:

• They are initialized using a literal (e.g., `100` or `"AAPL"`) or a built-in of "const" form (e.g., `color.green`).
• Their value does not change during the script's execution, meaning their value is never redefined using `:=`.

We use `SNAKE_CASE` to name these variables and group their declaration near the top of the script. For example:

```
// Constants
int MS_IN_MIN = 60 * 1000
int MS_IN_HOUR = MS_IN_MIN * 60
int MS_IN_DAY = MS_IN_HOUR * 24

color GRAY = #808080ff
color LIME = #00FF00ff
color MAROON = #800000ff
color ORANGE = #FF8000ff
color PINK = #FF0080ff
color TEAL = #008080ff
color BG_DIV = color.new(ORANGE, 90)
color BG_RESETS = color.new(GRAY, 90)

string RST1 = "No reset; cumulate since the beginning of the chart"
string RST2 = "On a stepped higher timeframe (HTF)"
string RST3 = "On a fixed HTF"
string RST4 = "At a fixed time"
string RST5 = "At the beginning of the regular session"
string RST6 = "At the first visible chart bar"
string RST7 = "Fixed rolling period"

string LTF1 = "Least precise, covering many chart bars"
string LTF2 = "Less precise, covering some chart bars"
string LTF3 = "More precise, covering less chart bars"
string LTF4 = "Most precise, 1min intrabars"

string TT_TOTVOL = "The 'Bodies' value is the transparency of the total volume can"
string TT_RST_HTF = "This value is used when '' + RST3 +'' is selected."
string TT_RST_TIME = "These values are used when '' + RST4 +'' is selected."
string TT_RST_PERIOD = "This value is used when '' + RST7 +'' is selected."
```

In this example:
• The `RST*` and `LTF*` constants will be used as tuple elements in the `options` argument of `input.*()` calls.
• The `TT*` constants will be used as `tooltip` arguments in `input.*()` calls. Note how we use a line continuation for long string literals.
• We do not use `var` to initialize constants. The Pine Script™ runtime is optimized to handle declarations on each bar, but using `var` to initialize a variable only the first time it is declared incurs a minor penalty on script performance because of the maintenance that `var` variables require on further bars.

Note that:
• Literals used in more than one place in a script should always be declared as a constant. Using the constant rather than the literal makes it more readable if it is given a meaningful name, and the practice makes code easier to maintain. Even though the quantity of milliseconds in a day is unlikely to change in the future, `MS_IN_DAY` is more meaningful than `1000 * 60 * 60 * 24`.
• Constants only used in the local block of a function or `if`, `while`, etc., statement for example, can be declared in that local block.

\<inputs>

It is much easier to read scripts when all their inputs are in the same code section. Placing that section at the
beginning of the script also reflects how they are processed at runtime, i.e., before the rest of the script is executed.
Suffixing input variable names with `input` makes them more readily identifiable when they are used later in the
script: `maLengthInput`, `bearColorInput`, `showAvgInput`, etc.

```
// Inputs
string resetInput       = input.string(RST2,       "CVD Resets", )
string fixedTfInput     = input.timeframe("D",       "Fixed HTF: ", )
int    hourInput        = input.int(9,       "Fixed time hour: ", )
int    minuteInput      = input.int(30,      "minute", )
int    fixedPeriodInput = input.int(20,      "Fixed period: ", )
string ltfModeInput     = input.string(LTF3,      "Intrabar precision", )
```

# <function_declarations>

All user-defined functions must be defined in the script's global scope; nested function definitions are not allowed in
Pine Script™.

Optimal function design should minimize the use of global variables in the function's scope, as they undermine
function portability. When it can't be avoided, those functions must follow the global variable declarations in the
code, which entails they can't always be placed in the `<function_declarations>` section. Such dependencies on global
variables should ideally be documented in the function's comments.

It will also help readers if you document the function's objective, parameters and result. The same syntax used in
 can be used to document your functions. This can make it easier to port your functions to a library should
you ever decide to do so.

```
//@version=5
indicator("<function declarations>", "", true)

string SIZE_LARGE  = "Large"
string SIZE_NORMAL = "Normal"
string SIZE_SMALL  = "Small"

string sizeInput = input.string(SIZE_NORMAL, "Size", options = [SIZE_LARGE, SIZE_NORMAL, SIZE_SMALL])

// @function
// @param userSize Used to produce an argument for the `size` parameter in built-in fu
//              (simple string) User-selected size.
// @returns       One of the `size.*` built-in constants.
// Dependencies: SIZE_LARGE, SIZE_NORMAL, SIZE_SMALL
getSize(simple string userSize) =>
    result =
        switch userSize
            SIZE_LARGE  => size.large
            SIZE_NORMAL => size.normal
            SIZE_SMALL  => size.small
            => size.auto

if ta.rising(close, 3)
    label.new(bar_index, na, yloc = yloc.abovebar, style = label.style_arrowup, size =
```

# <calculations>

This is where the script's core calculations and logic should be placed. Code can be easier to read when variable
declarations are placed near the code segment using the variables. Some programmers prefer to place all their non-
constant variable declarations at the beginning of this section, which is not always possible for all variables, as some
may require some calculations to have been executed before their declaration.

<strategy_calls>
Strategies are easier to read when strategy calls are grouped in the same section of the script.

<visuals>
This section should ideally include all the statements producing the script's visuals, whether they be plots, drawings,
background colors, candle-plotting, etc. See the Pine Script ™ User Manual's section on  for more information on
how the relative depth of visuals is determined.

<alerts>
Alert code will usually require the script's calculations to have executed before it, so it makes sense to put it at the
end of the script.

Spacing
A space should be used on both sides of all operators, except unary operators (-1). A space is also recommended
after all commas and when using named function arguments, as in `plot(series = close)`

```
int a = close > open ? 1 : -1
var int newLen = 2
newLen := min(20, newlen + 1)
float a = -b
float c = d > e? d : e : d
int index = bar_index % 2 == 0 ? 1 : 2
plot(close, color = color.red)
```

Line wrapping
Line wrapping can make long lines easier to read. Line wraps are defined by using an indentation level that is not a
multiple of four, as four spaces or a tab are used to define local blocks. Here we use two spaces:

```
plot(
  series = close,
  title = "Close",
  color = color.blue,
  show_last = 10
)
```

Vertical alignment
Vertical alignment using tabs or spaces can be useful in code sections containing many similar lines such as constant
declarations or inputs. They can make mass edits much easier using the Pine Script ™ Editor's multi-cursor feature
`ctrl + alt + AA/AA`

```
// Colors used as defaults in inputs.
color COLOR_AQUA  = #0080FFff
color COLOR_BLACK = #23000000ff
color COLOR_BLUE  = #013BCAff
color COLOR_CORAL = #FF8080ff
color COLOR_GOLD  = #CCCC00ff
```

## Explicit typing

Including the type of variables when declaring them is not required and is usually overkill for small scripts; we do not systematically use it. It can be useful to make the type of a function's result clearer, and to distinguish a variable's declaration (using `=`) from its reassignments (using `:=`). Using explicit typing can also make it easier for readers to find their way in larger scripts.

## Introduction

TradingView's close integration between the Pine Script ™ Editor and charts allows for efficient and interactive debugging of Pine Script ™ code. Once a Pine Script ™ programmer understands the most appropriate technique to use in each situation, he will be able to debug scripts quickly and thoroughly. This page demonstrates the most useful techniques to debug Pine Script ™ code.

If you are not yet familiar with Pine Script™'s execution model, it is important that you read the Execution model page of this User Manual so you understand how your debugging code will behave in the Pine Script™ environment.

## The lay of the land

Values plotted by Pine scripts can be displayed in four distinct places:

1. Next to the script's name (controlled by the "Indicator Values" checkbox in the “Chart settings/Status Line" tab).
2. In the script's pane, whether your script is a chart overlay or in a separate pane.
3. In the scale (only displays the last bar's value and is controlled by the "Indicator Last Value Label" checkbox in the "Chart settings/Scale" tab).
4. In the Data Window (which you can bring up using the fourth icon down, to the right of your chart).

Note the following in the preceding screenshot:

*   The chart's cursor is on the dataset's first bar, where `bar_index` is zero. That value is reflected next to the indicator's name and in the Data Window. Moving your cursor on other bars would update those values so they always represent the value of the plot on that bar. This is a good way to inspect the value of a variable as the script's execution progresses from bar to bar.
*   The `title` argument of our `plot()` call, "Bar Index", is used as the value's legend in the Data Window.
*   The precision of the values displayed in the Data Window is dependent on the chart symbol's tick value. You can modify it in two ways:
    *   By changing the value of the “Precision” field in the script's "Settings/Style" tab. You can obtain up to eight digits of precision using this method.
    *   By using the `precision` parameter in your script's `indicator()` or `strategy()` declaration statement. This method allows specifying up to 16 digits precision.
*   The `plot()` call in our script plots the value of `bar_index` in the indicator's pane, which shows the increasing value of the variable.
*   The scale of the script's pane is automatically sized to accommodate the smallest and largest values plotted by all `plot()` calls in the script.

# Displaying numeric values

## When the script's scale is unimportant

The script in the preceding screenshot used the simplest way to inspect numerical values: a `plot()` call, which plots a line corresponding to the variable's value in the script's display area. Our example script plotted the value of the `bar_index` built-in variable, which contains the bar's number, a value beginning at zero on the dataset's first bar and increased by one on each subsequent bar. We used a `plot()` call to plot the variable to inspect because our script was not plotting anything else; we were not preoccupied with preserving the scale for other plots to continue to plot normally. This is the script we used:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Plot `bar_index`")
plot(bar_index, "Bar Index")
```

## When the script's scale must be preserved

Plotting values in the script's display area is not always possible. When we already have other plots going on and
adding debugging plots of variables whose values fall outside the script's plotting boundaries would make the plots
unreadable, another technique must be used to inspect values if we want to preserve the scale of the other plots.
Suppose we want to continue inspecting the value of `bar_index`, but this time in a script where we are also plotting
RSI:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Plot RSI and `bar index`")
r = ta.rsi(close, 20)
plot(r, "RSI", color.black)
plot(bar_index, "Bar Index")
```

Running the script on a dataset containing a large number of bars yields the following display:



where:

1.  The RSI line in black is flat because it varies between zero and 100, but the indicator's pane is scaled to show
    the maximum value of `bar_index`, which is `25692.0000`.
2.  The value of `bar_index` on the bar the cursor is on is displayed next to the indicator's name, and its blue plot in
    the script's pane is flat.
3.  The `25692.0000` value of `bar_index` shown in the scale represents its value on the last bar, so the dataset
    contains 25693 bars.
4.  The value of `bar_index` on the bar the cursor is on is also displayed in the Data Window, along with that bar's
    value for RSI just above it.

In order to preserve our plot of RSI while still being able to inspect the value or `bar_index`, we will plot the variable
using `plotchar()` like this:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Plot RSI and `bar index`")
r = ta.rsi(close, 20)
plot(r, "RSI", color.black)
plotchar(bar_index, "Bar index", "", location.top)
```



where:

• Because the value of `bar_index` is no longer being plotted in the script's pane, the pane's boundaries are now those of RSI, which displays normally.
• The value plotted using `plotchar()` is displayed next to the script's name and in the Data Window.
• We are not plotting a character with our `plotchar()` call, so the third argument is an empty string (`""`). We are also specifying `location.top` as the `location` argument, so that we do not put the symbol's price in play in the calculation of the display area's boundaries.

Displaying strings

Pine Script™ labels must be used to display strings. Labels only appear in the script's display area; strings shown in labels do not appear in the Data Window or anywhere else.

Labels on each bar

The following script demonstrates the simplest way to repetitively draw a label showing the symbol's name:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Simple label", "", true)
label.new(bar_index, high, syminfo.ticker)
```

By default, only the last 50 labels will be shown on the chart. You can increase this amount up to a maximum of 500 by using the `max_labels_count` parameter in your script's `indicator()` or `strategy()` declaration statement. For example:

```
indicator("Simple label", "", true, max_labels_count = 500)
```

Labels on last bar

As strings manipulated in Pine scripts often do not change bar to bar, the method most frequently used to visualize them is to draw a label on the dataset's last bar. Here, we use a function to create a label that only appears on the chart's last bar. Our `f_print()` function has only one parameter, the text string to be displayed:

```
//@version=5
indicator("print()", "", true)
print(txt) =>
    // Create label on the first bar.
    var lbl = label.new(bar_index, na, txt, xloc.bar_index, yloc.price, color(na), label.style_label_down, size.small)
    // On next bars, update the label's x and y position, and the text it displays.
    label.set_xy(lbl, bar_index, ta.highest(10)[1])
    label.set_text(lbl, txt)

print("Multiplier = " + str.tostring(timeframe.multiplier) + "\nPeriod = " + timeframe.period)
print("Hello world!\n\n\n\n")
```

Note the following in our last code example:

*   We use the `print()` function to enclose the label-drawing code. While the function is called on each bar, the label is only created on the dataset's first bar because of our use of the `var` keyword when declaring the `lbl` variable inside the function. After creating it, we only update the label's x and y coordinates and its text on each successive bar. If we did not update those values, the label would remain on the dataset's first bar and would only display the text string's value on that bar. Lastly, note that we use `ta.highest(10)[1]` to position the label vertically, By using the highest high of the previous 10 bars, we prevent the label from moving during the realtime bar. You may need to adapt this y position in other contexts.
*   We call the `print()` function twice to show that if you make multiple calls because it makes debugging multiple strings easier, you can superimpose their text by using the correct amount of newlines `(\n)` to separate each one.
*   We use the `str.tostring()` function to convert numeric values to a string for inclusion in the text to be displayed.

## Debugging conditions

### Single conditions

Many methods can be used to display occurrences where a condition is met. This code shows six ways to identify bars where RSI is smaller than 30:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Single conditions")
r = ta.rsi (close, 20)
rIsLow = r < 30
hline (30)

// Method #1: Change the plot's color.
plot(r, "RSI", rIsLow ? color.fuchsia : color.black)
// Method #2: Plot a character in the bottom region of the display.
plotchar(rIsLow, "rIsLow char at bottom", "A", location.bottom, size = size.small)
// Method #3: Plot a character on the RSI line.
plotchar(rIsLow ? r : na, "rIsLow char on line", ".", location.absolute, color.red, si:
// Method #4: Plot a shape in the top region of the display.
plotshape(rIsLow, "rIsLow shape", shape.arrowup, location.top)
// Method #5: Plot an arrow.
plotarrow(rIsLow ? 1 : na, "rIsLow arrow")
// Method #6: Change the background's color.
bgcolor(rIsLow ? color.new(color.green, 90) : na)
```

Note that:
* We define our condition in the `rIsLow` boolean variable and it is evaluated on each bar. The `r < 30` expression used to assign a value to the variable evaluates to `true` or `false` (or `na` when `r` is `na`, as is the case in the first bars of the dataset).
* Method #1 uses a change in the color of the RSI plot on the condition. Whenever a plot's color changes, it colors the plot starting from the preceding bar.
* Method #2 uses `plotchar()` to plot an up triangle in the bottom part of the indicator's display. Using different combinations of positions and characters allows the simultaneous identification of multiple conditions on a single bar. This is one of our preferred methods to identify conditions on the chart.
* Method #3 also uses a `plotchar()` call, but this time the character is positioned on the RSI line. In order to achieve this, we use `location.absolute` and Pine Script™'s `?:` ternary conditional operator to define a conditional expression where a y position is used only when our `rIsLow` condition is true. When it is not true, `na` is used, so no character is displayed.
* Method #4 uses `plotshape()` to plot a blue up arrow in the top part of the indicator's display area when our condition is met.
* Method #5 uses `plotarrow()` to plot a green up arrow at the bottom of the display when our condition is met.
* Method #6 uses `bgcolor()` to change the color of the background when our condition is met. The ternary operator is used once again to evaluate our condition. It will return `color.green` when `rIsLow` is true, and the `na` color (which does not color the background) when `risLow` is false or `na`.
* Lastly, note how a boolean variable with a `true` value displays as `1` in the Data Window. `false` values are denoted by a zero value.

### Compound conditions

Programmers needing to identify situations where more than one condition is met must build compound conditions by
aggregating individual conditions using the `and` logical operator. Because compound conditions will only perform as
expected if their individual conditions trigger correctly, you will save yourself many headaches if you validate the
behavior of individual conditions before using a compound condition in your code.

The state of multiple individual conditions can be displayed using a technique like this one, where four individual
conditions are used to build our `bull` compound condition:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Compound conditions")
periodInput = input.int(20)
bullLevelInput = input.int(55)

r = ta.rsi(close, periodInput)

// Condition #1.
rsiBull = r > bullLevelInput
// Condition #2.
hiChannel = ta.highest(r, periodInput * 2) [1]
aboveHiChannel = r> hiChannel
// Condition #3.
channelIsOld = hiChannel >= hiChannel [periodInput]
// Condition #4.
historyIsBull = math.sum(rsiBull ? 1 : -1, periodInput * 3) > 0
// Compound condition.
bull = rsiBull and aboveHiChannel and channelIsOld and historyIsBull

hline (bullLevelInput)
plot(r, "RSI", color.black)
plot(hiChannel, "High Channel")
plotchar(rsiBull ? bullLevelInput: na, "rIsBull", "1", location.absolute, color.green,
plotchar (aboveHiChannel ? r : na, "aboveHiChannel", "2", location.absolute, size = size
plotchar(channelIsOld, "channelIsOld", "3", location.bottom, size = size.tiny)
plotchar (historyIsBull, "historyIsBull", "4", location.top, size = size.tiny)
bgcolor (bull ? not bull [1] ? color.new(color.green, 50) : color.new(color.green, 90) :
```

Note that:

*   We use a `plotchar()` call to display each condition's number, taking care to spread them over the indicator's y
    space so they don't overlap.
*   The first two `plotchar()` calls use absolute positioning to place the condition number so that it helps us
    remember the corresponding condition. The first one which displays "1" when RSI is higher than the user-
    defined bull level for example, positions the "1" on the bull level.
*   We use two different shades of green to color the background: the brighter one indicates the first bar where our
    compound condition becomes `true`, the lighter green identifies subsequent bars where our compound condition
    continues to be true.

• While it is not always strictly necessary to assign individual conditions to a variable because they can be used directly in boolean expressions, it makes for more readable code when you assign a condition to a variable name that will remind you and your readers of what it represents. Readability considerations should always prevail in cases like this one, where the hit on performance of assigning conditions to variable names is minimal or null.

## Debugging from inside functions

Variables in function are local to the function, so not available for plotting from the script's global scope. In this script we have written the `hlca()` function to calculate a weighed average:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Debugging from inside functions", "", true)
hlca () =>
    var float avg = na
    hlca = math.avg(high, low, close, nz(avg, close))
    avg := ta.sma (hlca, 20)
    h = hlca ()
    plot(h)
```

We need to inspect the value of `hlca` in the function's local scope as the function calculates, bar to bar. We cannot access the `hlca` variable used inside the function from the script's global scope. We thus need another mechanism to pull that variable's value from inside the function's local scope, while still being able to use the function's result. We can use Pine Script™'s ability to have functions return a tuple to gain access to the variable:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Debugging from inside functions", "", true)
hlca() =>
    var float avg = na
    instantVal = math.avg (high, low, close, nz(avg, close))
    avg := ta.sma(instantVal, 20)
    // Return two values instead of one.
    [avg, instantVal]

[h, instantVal] = hlca ()
plot(h, "h")
plot(instantVal, "instantVal", color.black)
```

Contrary to global scope variables, array elements of globally defined arrays can be modified from within functions.
We can use this feature to write a functionally equivalent script:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Debugging from inside functions", "", true)
// Create an array containing only one float element.
instantValGlobal = array.new_float(1)
hlca () =>
    var float avg = na
    instantVal = math.avg(high, low, close, nz(avg, close))
    // Set the array's only element to the current value of instantVal`.
    array.set(instantValGlobal, 0, instantVal)
    avg := ta.sma (instantVal, 20)

h = hlca ()
plot(h, "h")
// Retrieve the value of the array's only element which was set from inside the functio
plot(array.get(instantValGlobal, 0), "instantValGlobal", color.black)
```

## Debugging from inside `for` loops

Values inside for loops cannot be plotted using `plot()` calls in the loop. As in functions, such variables are also local to
the loop's scope. Here, we explore three different techniques to inspect variable values originating from `for` loops,
starting from this code example, which calculates the balance of bars in the lookback period which have a
higher/lower true range value than the current bar:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Debugging from inside `for` loops")
lookbackInput = input.int(20, minval = 0)

float trBalance = 0
for i = 1 to lookbackInput
    trBalance := trBalance + math.sign(ta.tr - ta.tr[i])

hline (0)
plot(trBalance)
```

## Extracting a single value

If we want to inspect the value of a variable at a single point in the loop, we can save it and plot it once the loop is
exited. Here, we save the value of `tr` in the `val` variable at the loop's last iteration:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Debugging from inside `for` loops", max_lines_count = 500, max_labels_count = 500)
lookbackInput = input.int(20, minval = 0)

float val = na
float trBalance = 0
for i = 1 to lookbackInput
    trBalance := trBalance + math.sign(ta.tr - ta.tr[i])
    if i == lookbackInput
        val := ta.tr[i]

hline (0)
plot(trBalance)
plot(val, "val", color.black)
```

# Using lines and labels

When we want to extract values from more than one loop iteration we can use lines and labels. Here we draw a line corresponding to the value of `ta.tr` used in each loop iteration. We also use a label to display, for each line, the loop's index and the line's value. This gives us a general idea of the values being used in each loop iteration:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Debugging from inside `for` loops", max_lines_count = 500, max_labels_count = 500)
lookbackInput = input.int(20, minval = 0)

float trBalance = 0
for i = 1 to lookbackInput
    trBalance := trBalance + math.sign(ta.tr - ta.tr[i])
    line.new(bar_index[1], ta.tr[i], bar_index, ta.tr[i], color = color.black)
    label.new(bar_index, ta.tr[i], str.tostring(i) + "." + str.tostring(ta.tr[i]), style=label.style_label_down)

hline(0)
plot(trBalance)
```

Debugging from inside 'for' loops

Note that:
* To show more detail, the scale in the preceding screenshot has been manually expanded by clicking and dragging the scale area.
* We use `max_lines_count = 500, max_labels_count = 500` in our `indicator()` declaration statement to display the maximum number of lines and labels.
* Each loop iteration does not necessarily produce a distinct `ta.tr` value, which is why we may not see 20 distinct lines for each bar.
* If we wanted to show only one level, we could use the same technique while isolating a specific loop iteration as we did in the preceding example.

Extracting multiple values

We can also extract multiple values from loop iterations by building a single string which we will display using a label after the loop executes:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Debugging from inside `for` loops", max_lines_count = 500, max_labels_count = 0)
lookbackInput = input.int(20, minval = 0)

string = ""
float trBalance = 0
for i = 1 to lookbackInput
    trBalance := trBalance + math.sign(ta.tr - ta.tr[i])
    string := string + str.tostring(i, "00") + "." + str.tostring(ta.tr[i]) + "\n"

label.new(bar_index, 0, string, style = label.style_none, size = size.small, textalign.left)
hline (0)
plot(trBalance)
```

Note that:

*   The scale in the preceding screenshot has been manually expanded by clicking and dragging the scale area so the content of the indicator's display area content could be moved vertically to show only its relevant part.
*   We use `str.tostring(i, "00")` to force the display of the loop's index to zero-padded two digits so they align neatly.

When loops with numerous iterations make displaying all their values impractical, you can sample a subset of the iterations. This code uses the `%` (modulo) operator to include values from every second loop iteration:

```pine
for i = 1 to i lookBack
    lowerRangeBalance := lowerRangeBalance + math.sign(ta.tr - ta.tr[i])
    if i % 2 == 0
        string := string + str.tostring(i, "00") + "." + str.tostring(ta.tr[i]) + "\n"
```

## Tips

The two techniques we use most frequently to debug our Pine Script ™ code are:

```pine
plotchar(v, "v", "", location.top, size = size.tiny)
```

to plot variables of type float, int or bool in the indicator's values and the Data Window, and the one-line version of our `print()` function to debug strings:

```pine
print(txt) => var label = label.new(bar_index, na, txt, xloc.bar_index, yloc.price, color.green)
print(stringName)
```

As we use AutoHotkey for Windows to speed repetitive tasks, we include these lines in our AutoHotkey script (this is not Pine Script ™ code):

; This is AHK code, not Pine Script™.
`^+f:: SendInput plotchar(^v, "^v", "", location.top, size = size.tiny) {Return}`
`^+p:: SendInput print(txt) => var lbl = label.new(bar_index, na, txt, xloc.bar_index,`

The second line will type a debugging `plotchar()` call including an expression or variable name previously copied to the clipboard when we use `ctrl` + `shift` + `f`. Copying the `variableName` variable name or the `close > open` conditional expression to the clipboard and hitting `ctrl` + `shift` + `f` will, respectively, yield:

```
plotchar(variableName, "variableName", "", location.top, size = size.tiny)
plotchar(close > open, "close > open", "", location.top, size = size.tiny)
```

The third line triggers on `ctrl` + `shift` + `p`. It types our one-line `print()` function in a script and on a second line, an empty call to the function with the cursor placed so all that's left to do is type the string we want to display:

```
print(txt) => var lbl = label.new(bar_index, na, txt, xloc.bar_index, yloc.price, color
print()
```

Note: AutoHotkey works only on Windows systems. Keyboard Maestro or others can be substituted on Apple systems.

        *   Open
        *   Protected
        *   Invite-only
*   Preparing a publication
*   Publishing a script
*   Updating a publication

Programmers who wish to share their Pine scripts with other traders can publish them.

**Note**
If you write scripts for your personal use, there is no need to publish them; you can save them in the Pine Script™ Editor and use the "Add to Chart" button to add your script to your chart.

# Script visibility and access

When you publish a script, you control its visibility and access:

*   Visibility is controlled by choosing to publish publicly or privately. See  in the Help Center for more details. Publish publicly when you have written a script you think can be useful to TradingViewers. Public scripts are subject to moderation. To avoid moderation, ensure your publication complies with our  and . Publish privately when you don't want your script visible to all other users, but want to share it with a few friends.
*   Access determines if users will see your source code, and how they will be able to use your script. There are three access types: open, protected (reserved to paid accounts) or invite-only (reserved to Premium accounts). See  in the Help Center for more details.

# When you publish a script

*   The publication's title is determined by the argument used for the `title` parameter in the script's `indicator()` or `strategy()` declaration statement. That title is also used when TradingViewers search for script names.
*   The name of your script on the chart will be the argument used for the `shorttitle` parameter in the script's
*   `indicator()` or `strategy()` declaration statement, or the title argument in `library()`.
*   Your script must have a description explaining what your script does and how to use it.
*   The chart you are using when you publish will become visible in your publication, including any other scripts or drawings on it. Remove unrelated scripts or drawings from your chart before publishing your script.
*   Your script's code can later be updated. Each update can include release notes which will appear, dated, under your original description.
*   Scripts can be liked, shared, commented on or reported by other users.
*   Your published scripts appear under the “SCRIPTS” tab of your user profile.
*   A script widget and a script page are created for your script. The script widget is your script's placeholder showing in script feeds on the platform. It contains your script's title, chart and the first few lines of your description. When users click on your script widget, the script's page opens. It contains all the information relating to your script.

# Visibility

## Public

When you publish a public script:

*   Your script will be inluded in our  where it becomes visible to the millions of TradingViewers on all internationalized versions of the site.
*   Your publication must comply with  and .
*   If your script is an invite-only script, you must comply with our .
*   It becomes accessible through the search functions for scripts.
*   You will not be able to edit your original description or its title, nor change its public/private visibility, nor its access type (open-source, protected, invite-only).
*   You will not be able to delete your publication.

## Private

When you publish a private script:

*   It will not be visible to other users unless you share its url with them.
*   It is visible to you from your user profile's "SCRIPTS" tab.
*   Private scripts are identifiable by the "X" and "lock" icons in the top-right of their widget. The "X" is used to delete it.
*   It is not moderated, unless you sell access to it or make it available publicly, as it is then no longer “private”.
*   You can update its original description and title.
*   You cannot link to or mentioned it from any public TradingView content (ideas, script descriptions, comments, chats, etc.).
*   It is not accessible through the search functions for scripts.

# Access

Public or private scripts can be published using one of three access types: open, protected or invite-only. The access type you can select from will vary with the type of account you hold.

## Open

The Pine Script ™ code of scripts published **open** is visible to all users. Open-source scripts on TradingView use the Mozilla license by default, but you may choose any license you want. You can find information on licensing at .

## Protected

The code of **protected** scripts is hidden from view and no one but its author can access it. While the script's code is
not accessible, protected scripts can be used freely by any user. Only Pro, Pro+ or Premium accounts may publish
public protected scripts.

## Invite-only
The invite-only access type protects both the script's code and its use. The publisher of an invite-only script must
explicitly grant access to individual users. Invite-only scripts are mostly used by script vendors providing paid access
to their scripts. Only Premium accounts can publish invite-only scripts, and they must comply with our .

TradingView does not benefit from script sales. Transactions concerning invite-only scripts are strictly between users
and vendors; they do not involve TradingView.

Public invite-only scripts are the only scripts for which vendors are allowed to ask for payment on TradingView.

On their invite-only script's page, authors will see a "Manage Access" button. The "Manage Access" window allows
authors to control who has access to their script.

*(Image of the Invite-only script settings)*

## Preparing a publication
1. Even if you intend to publish publicly, it is always best to start with a private publication because you can use it
to validate what your final publication will look like. You can edit the title, description, code or chart of private
publications, and contrary to public scripts, you can delete private scripts when you don't need them anymore,
so they are the perfect way to practice before sharing a script publicly. You can read more about preparing
script descriptions in the  publication.
2. Prepare your chart. Load your script on the chart and remove other scripts or drawings that won't help users
understand your script. Your script's plots should be easy to identify on the chart that will be published with it.
3. Load your code in the Pine Editor if it isn't already. In the Editor, click the "Publish Script” button:
4. A popup appears to remind you that if you publish publicly, it's important that your publication comply with House Rules. Once you're through the popup, place your description in the field below the script's title. The default title proposed for your publication is the `title` field from your script's code. It is always best to use that title; it makes it easier for users to search for your script if it is public. Select the visibility of your publication. We want to publish a private publication, so we check the "Private Script" checkbox at the bottom- right of the "Publish Script" window:
5. Select the access type you want for your script: Open, Protected or Invite-only. We have selected "Open" for open-source.

Aroon with dynamic colors

The Aroon Indicator (often referred to as Aroon Up Down) is a range bound, technical indicator that is actually a set of two separate
measurements designed to measure how many periods have passed since price has recorded an n-period high or low low with "n"
being a number of periods set at the trader's discretion. For example a 14 Day Aroon-Up will take the number of days since price last
recorded a 14 day high and then calculate a number between 0 and 100. A 14 Day Aroon-Down will do the same thing except is will
calculate a number based of the number of days since a 14 day low. This number is intended to quantify the strength of a trend (if
there is one). The closer the number is to 100, the stronger the trend. Aroon is not only good at identifying trends, it is also a useful
tool for identifying periods of consolidation.

7. Click the "Publish Private Script" button in the lower-right of the window. When the publication is complete,
your published script's page will appear. You are done! You can confirm the publication by going to your User
Profile and viewing your "SCRIPTS” tab. From there, you will be able to open your script's page and edit your
private publication by using the "Edit" button in the top-right of your script's page. Note that you can also
update private publications, just like you can public ones. If you want to share your private publication with a
friend, privately send her the url from your script's page. Remember you are not allowed to share links to
private publications in public TradingView content.

## Publishing a script

Whether you intend to publish privately or publicly, first follow the steps in the previous section. If you intend to
publish privately, you will be done. If you intend to publish publicly and are satisfied with the preparatory process of
validating your private publication, follow the same steps as above but do not check the "Private Script" checkbox
and click the "Publish Public Script” button at the bottom-right of the "Publish Script" page.

When you publish a new public script, you have a 15-minute window to make changes to your description or delete
the publication. After that you will no longer be able to change your publication's title, description, visiblity or access
type. If you make an error, send a message to the PineCoders moderator account; they moderate script publications
and will help.

# Updating a publication

You can update both public or private script publications. When you update a script, its code must be different than the previously published version's code. You can add release notes with your update. They will appear after your script's original description in the script's page.

By default, the chart used when you update will replace the previous chart in your script's page. You can choose not to update your script page's chart, however. Note that while you can update the chart displayed in the script's page, the chart from the script's widget will not update.

In the same way you can validate a public publication by first publishing a private script, you can also validate an update on a private publication before proceeding with it on your public one. The process of updating a published script is the same for public and private scripts.

If you intend to update both the code and chart of your published script, prepare your chart the same way you would for a new publication. In the following example, we will not be updating the publication's chart:

1. As you would for a new publication, load your script in the Editor and click the "Publish Script” button.
2. Once in the "Publish Script" window, select the "Update Existing Script" button. Then select the script to update from the "Choose script" dropdown menu:

    - Number of calls
    - Intrabars
    - Tuple element limit
- Script size and memory

    - Variables
    - Arrays and matrices
- Other limitations
    - Maximum bars back
    - Maximum bars forward
    - Chart bars
    - Trade orders in backtesting

## Introduction

As is mentioned in our :

Because each script uses computational resources in the cloud, we must impose limits in order to share these resources fairly among our users. We strive to set as few limits as possible, but will of course have to implement as many as needed for the platform to run smoothly. Limitations apply to the amount of data requested from additional symbols, execution time, memory usage and script size.

If you develop complex scripts using Pine Script™, sooner or later you will run into some of the limitations we impose. This section provides you with an overview of the limitations that you may encounter. There are currently no means for Pine Script™ programmers to get data on the resources consumed by their scripts. We hope this will change in the future.
In the meantime, when you are considering large projects, it is safest to make a proof of concept in order to assess the probability of your script running into limitations later in your project.
Here are the limits imposed in the Pine Script ™ environment.

## Time

### Script compilation

Scripts must compile before they are executed on charts. Compilation occurs when you save a script from the editor or when you add a script to the chart. A two-minute limit is imposed on compilation time, which will depend on the size and complexity of your script, and whether or not a cached version of a previous compilation is available. When a compile exceeds the two-minute limit, a warning is issued. Heed that warning by shortening your script because after three consecutives warnings a one-hour ban on compilation attempts is enforced. The first thing to consider when optimizing code is to avoid repetitions by using functions to encapsulate oft-used segments, and call functions instead of repeating code.

### Script execution

Once a script is compiled it can be executed. See the Events triggering the execution of a script for a list of the events triggering the execution of a script. The time allotted for the script to execute on all bars of a dataset varies with account types. The limit is 20 seconds for basic accounts, 40 for others.

### Loop execution

The execution time for any loop on any single bar is limited to 500 milliseconds. The outer loop of embedded loops counts as one loop, so it will time out first. Keep in mind that even though a loop may execute under the 500 ms time limit on a given bar, the time it takes to execute on all the dataset's bars may nonetheless cause your script to exceed the total execution time limit. For example, the limit on total execution time will make it impossible for you script to execute a 400 ms loop on each bar of a 20,000-bar dataset because your script would then need 8000 seconds to execute.

## Chart visuals

### Plot limits

A maximum of 64 plot counts are allowed per script. The functions that generate plot counts are:
• plot()
• plotarrow()
• plotbar()
• plotcandle()
• plotchar()
• plotshape()
• alertcondition()
• bgcolor()
• fill(), but only if its `color` is of the `series` form.

The following functions do not generate plot counts:

- hline()
- line.new()
- label.new()
- table.new()
- box.new()

One function call can generate up to seven plot counts, depending on the function and how it is called. When your
script exceeds the maximum of 64 plot counts, the runtime error message will display the plot count generated by
your script. Once you reach that point, you can determine how many plot counts a function call generates by
commenting it out in a script. As long as your script still throws an error, you will be able to see how the actual plot
count decreases after you have commented out a line.

The following example shows different function calls and the number of plot counts each one will generate:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Plot count example")

bool isUp = close > open
color isUpColor = isUp ? color.green : color.red
bool isDn = not isUp
color isDnColor = isDn ? color.red : color.green

// Uses one plot count each.
p1 = plot(close, color = color.white)
p2 = plot(open, color = na)

// Uses two plot counts for the `close` and `color` series.
plot(close, color = isUpColor)

// Uses one plot count for the `close` series.
plotarrow(close, colorup = color.green, colordown = color.red)

// Uses two plot counts for the `close` and `colorup` series.
plotarrow(close, colorup = isUpColor)

// Uses three plot counts for the `close`, `colorup`, and the `colordown` series.
plotarrow(close - open, colorup = isUpColor, colordown = isDnColor)

// Uses four plot counts for the `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close` series.
plotbar(open, high, low, close, color = color.white)

// Uses five plot counts for the `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, and `color` series.
plotbar(open, high, low, close, color = isUpColor)

// Uses four plot counts for the `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close` series.
plotcandle(open, high, low, close, color = color.white, wickcolor = color.white, bordercolor

// Uses five plot counts for the `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, and `color` series.
plotcandle(open, high, low, close, color = isUpColor, wickcolor = color.white, bordercolor

// Uses six plot counts for the `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `color`, and `wickcolor` series.
plotcandle(open, high, low, close, color = isUpColor, wickcolor = isUpColor , bordercolor

// Uses seven plot counts for the `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `color`, `wickcolor`, and `bordercolor` series.
plotcandle(open, high, low, close, color = isUpColor, wickcolor = isUpColor , bordercolor

// Uses one plot count for the `close` series.
plotchar(close, color = color.white, text = "|", textcolor = color.white)

// Uses two plot counts for the `close` and `color` series.
plotchar(close, color = isUpColor, text = "—", textcolor = color.white)

// Uses three plot counts for the `close`, `color`, and `textcolor` series.
plotchar(close, color = isUpColor, text = "O", textcolor = isUp ? color.yellow : color.white
```

```
// Uses one plot count for the `close` series.
`plotshape(close, color = color.white, textcolor = color.white)`

// Uses two plot counts for the `close` and `color` series.
`plotshape(close, color = isUpColor, textcolor = color.white)`

// Uses three plot counts for the `close`, `color`, and `textcolor` series.
`plotshape(close, color = isUpColor, textcolor = isUp? color.yellow: color.white)`

// Uses one plot count.
`alertcondition(close > open, "close > open", "Up bar alert")`

// Uses one plot count.
`bgcolor(isUp ? color.yellow : color.white)`

// Uses one plot count for the `color` series.
`fill(p1, p2, color = isUpColor)`
```

This example generates a plot count of 56. If we were to add two more instances of the last call to `plotcandle()`, the
script would throw an error stating that the script now uses 70 plot counts, as each additional call to `plotcandle()`
generates seven plot counts, and 56 + (7 * 2) is 70.

### Line, box, and label limits

Contrary to plots which can cover the entire dataset, by default, only the last 50 lines drawn by a script are visible on
charts. The same goes for boxes and labels. You can increase the quantity of drawing objects preserved on charts up
to a maximum of 500 by using the `max_lines_count`, `max_boxes_count` or `max_labels_count` parameters in
the `indicator()` or `strategy()` declaration statements.

In this example we set the maximum quantity of last labels shown on the chart to 100:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Label limits example", max_labels_count = 100, overlay = true)
label.new(bar_index, high, str.tostring(high, format.mintick))
```

It's important to note that when you set any of the attributes of a drawing object to na, it still counts as a drawing on
the chart and thus contributes to a script's drawing totals. To demonstrate this, the following script draws a "Buy"
and "Sell" label on each bar with x values determined by the `longCondition` and `shortCondition` variables.
The "Buy" label's x value is na when the bar index is even, and the "Sell" label's x value is na when the bar index
is odd. Although the `max_labels_count` is 10 in this example, we can see that the script displays fewer than ten
labels on the chart since the ones with na values also count toward the total:

```
//@version=5
// Approximate maximum number of label drawings
MAX_LABELS = 10
indicator("labels with na", overlay = false, max_labels_count = MAX_LABELS)

// Add background color for the last MAX LABELS bars.
bgcolor (bar_index > last_bar_index - MAX_LABELS ? color.new(color.green, 80) : na)

longCondition = bar_index % 2 != 0
shortCondition = bar_index % 2 == 0

// Add "Buy" and "Sell" labels on each new bar.
label.new(longCondition ? bar_index: na, 0, text = "Buy", color = color.new(color.green, 0))
label.new(shortCondition ? bar_index: na, 0, text = "Sell", color = color.new(color.red, 0))

plot(longCondition ? 1 : 0)
plot(shortCondition ? 1 : 0)
```

If we want the script to display the desired number of labels, we need to eliminate the ones with na x values so that they don't add to the script's label count. This example conditionally draws the "Buy" and "Sell" labels rather than always drawing them and setting their attributes to na on alternating bars:

```pine
//@version=5
// Approximate maximum number of label drawings
MAX_LABELS = 10
indicator("conditional labels", overlay = false, max_labels_count = MAX LABELS)

// Add background color for the last MAX_LABELS bars.
bgcolor(bar_index > last_bar_index - MAX_LABELS ? color.new(color.green, 80) : na)

longCondition = bar_index % 2 != 0
shortCondition = bar_index % 2 == 0

// Add a "Buy" label when `longCondition` is true.
if longCondition
    label.new(bar_index, 0, text = "Buy", color = color.new(color.green, 0), style = label.style_labelup)

// Add a "Sell" label when `shortCondition` is true.
if shortCondition
    label.new(bar_index, 0, text = "Sell", color = color.new(color.red, 0), style = label.style_labeldown)

plot(longCondition ? 1 : 0)
plot(shortCondition ? 1 : 0)
```

### Table limits
A maximum of nine tables can be displayed by a script, one for each of the possible locations:
`position.bottom_center`, `position.bottom_left`, `position.bottom_right`, `position.middle_center`, `position.middle_left`,
`position.middle_right`, `position.top_center`, `position.top_left`, or `position.top_right`. If you place two tables in the
same position, only the most recently added table will be visible.

## `request.*()` calls

### Number of calls
A script cannot make more than 40 calls to `request.*()` functions. All instances of calls to these functions are
counted, even if they are included in code blocks or functions that are never actually used in the script's logic. The
functions counting towards this limit are: `request.security()`, `request.security_lower_tf()`, `request.quandl()`,
`request.financial()`, `request.dividends()`, `request.earnings()` and `request.splits()`.

### Intrabars
When accessing lower timeframes, with `request.security()` or `request.security_lower_tf()`, a maximum of 100,000
intrabars can be used in calculations.

The quantity of chart bars covered with 100,000 intrabars will vary with the ratio of the chart's timeframe to the
lower timeframe used, and with the average number of intrabars contained in each chart bar. For example, when
using a 1min lower timeframe, chart bars at the 60min timeframe of an active 24x7 market will usually contain 60
intrabars each. Because 100,000 / 60 = 1666.67, the quantity of chart bars covered by the 100,000 intrabars will
typically be 1666. On markets where 60min chart bars do not always contain 60 1min intrabars, more chart bars will
be covered.

### Tuple element limit

All the `request.*()` functions in one script taken together cannot return more than 127 tuple values. Below we have an example showing what can cause this error and how to work around it:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator ("Tuple values error")

// CAUSES ERROR:
[v1, v2, v3,...] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", [s1, s2, s3,...])

// Works fine:
type myType
    int v1
    int v2
    int v3

myObj = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", myType.new())
```

Note that:

*   In this example, we have a `request.security()` function with at least three values in our tuple, and we could either have more than 127 values in our tuple above or more than 127 values between multiple `request.security()` functions to throw this error.
*   We get around the error by simply creating a User-defined object that can hold the same values without throwing an error.
*   Using the `myType.new()` function is functionally the same as listing the same values in our `[s1, s2, s3,...]` tuple.

## Script size and memory

### Compiled tokens

Before a script is executed, it is compiled into a tokenized Intermediate Language (IL). Using an IL allows Pine Script™ to accommodate longer scripts by applying various optimizations before it is executed. The compiled form of indicators and strategies is limited to 60,000 tokens; libraries have a limit of 1 million tokens. There is no way to inspect the number of tokens created during compilation; you will only know your script exceeds the limit when the compiler reaches it.

Replacing code repetitions with function calls and using libraries to offload some of the workload are the most efficient ways to decrease the number of tokens your compiled script will generate.

The size of variable names and comments do not affect the number of compiled tokens.

### Local blocks

Local blocks are segments of indented code used in function definitions or in `if`, `switch`, `for` or `while` structures, which allow for one or more local blocks.

Scripts are limited to 500 local blocks.

### Variables

A maximum of 1000 variables are allowed per scope. Pine scripts always contain one global scope, and can contain

### Arrays and matrices
Arrays and matrices are limited to 100,000 elements.

## Other limitations

### Maximum bars back
References to past values using the [] history-referencing operator are dependent on the size of the historical buffer
maintained by the Pine Script ™ runtime, which is limited to a maximum of 5000 bars. This Help Center page discusses
the historical buffer and how to change its size using either the max_bars_back parameter or the max_bars_back()
function.

### Maximum bars forward
When positioning drawings using xloc.bar_index, it is possible to use bar index values greater than that of the
current bar as x coordinates. A maximum of 500 bars in the future can be referenced.
This example shows how we use the maxval parameter in our input.int() function call to cap the user-defined number
of bars forward we draw a projection line so that it never exceeds the limit:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Max bars forward example", overlay = true)
// This function draws a `line` using bar index x-coordinates.
drawLine (bar1, y1, bar2, y2) =>
// Only execute this code on the last bar.
if barstate.islast
// Create the line only the first time this function is executed on the last ba
var line lin = line.new(bar1, y1, bar2, y2, xloc.bar_index)
// Change the line's properties on all script executions on the last bar.
line.set_xy1(lin, bar1, y1)
line.set_xy2(lin, bar2, y2)
// Input determining how many bars forward we draw the `line`.
int forwardBarsInput = input.int(10, "Forward Bars to Display", minval = 1, maxval 50
// Calculate the line's left and right points.
int leftBar = bar_index[2]
float leftY = high [2]
int rightBar = leftBar + forwardBarsInput
float rightY = lefty + (ta.change (high) [1]
*
forwardBarsInput)
// This function call is executed on all bars, but it only draws the `line` on the last
drawLine (leftBar, lefty, rightBar, rightY)
```

### Chart bars
The number of bars appearing on charts is dependent on the amount of historical data available for the chart's symbol
and timeframe, and on the type of account you hold. When the required historical date is available, the minimum
number of chart bars is:

- 20,000 bars for the Premium plan.
- 10,000 bars for Pro and Pro+ plans.
- 5000 bars for other plans.

## Trade orders in backtesting

A maximum of 9000 orders can be placed when backtesting strategies. When using Deep Backtesting, the limit is
200,000.

 and we've added a pine script on it:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Visible OHLC", overlay=true)
c = close
plot(c)
```

You may see that variable `c` is a Heikin Ashi close price which is not the same as real OHLC price. Because `close` built-in variable is always a value that corresponds to a visible bar (or candle) on the chart.

So, how do we get the real OHLC prices in Pine Script™ code, if current chart type is non-standard? We should use `request.security` function in combination with `ticker.new` function. Here is an example:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Real OHLC", overlay = true)
t = ticker.new(syminfo.prefix, syminfo.ticker)
realc = request.security(t, timeframe.period, close)
plot(realc)
```

In a similar way we may get other OHLC prices: open, high and low.

## Get non-standard OHLC values on a standard chart

Backtesting on non-standard chart types (e.g. Heikin Ashi or Renko) is not recommended because the bars on these
kinds of charts do not represent real price movement that you would encounter while trading. If you want your
strategy to enter and exit on real prices but still use Heikin Ashi-based signals, you can use the same method to get
Heikin Ashi values on a regular candlestick chart:

```pine
//@version=5
strategy("BarUpDn Strategy", overlay = true, default_qty_type = strategy.percent_of_equ
maxIdLossPcntInput = input.float(1, "Max Intraday Loss(%)")
strategy.risk.max_intraday_loss(maxIdLossPcntInput, strategy.percent_of_equity)
needTrade() => close > open and open > close[1] ? 1 : close < open and open < close[1]
trade = request.security(ticker.heikinashi(syminfo.tickerid), timeframe.period, needTra
if trade == 1
    strategy.entry("BarUp", strategy.long)
if trade == -1
    strategy.entry("BarDn", strategy.short)
```

## Plot arrows on the chart

You may use `plotshape` with style `shape.arrowup` and `shape.arrowdown`:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator('Ex 1', overlay = true)
condition = close >= open
plotshape(condition, color = color.lime, style = shape.arrowup, text = "Buy")
plotshape(not condition, color = color.red, style = shape.arrowdown, text = "Sell")
```

**(Image of chart with buy and sell arrows)**

You may use `plotchar` function with any unicode character:

```pine
//@version=5
indicator('buy/sell arrows', overlay = true)
condition = close >= open
plotchar(not condition, char='↓', color = color.lime, text = "Buy")
plotchar(condition, char='↑', location = location.belowbar, color = color.red, text = "
```

## Plot a dynamic horizontal line

There is function `hline` in pine. But it is now limited to only plot constant value. Here is a Pine Script™ with workaround to plot changing hline:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Horizontal line", overlay = true)
plot(close[10], trackprice = true, offset = -9999)
// `trackprice = true` plots horizontal line on close[10]
// `offset = -9999` hides the plot
plot(close, color = #FFFFFFFF) // forces display
```

## Plot a vertical line on condition

```
//@version=5
indicator("Vertical line", overlay = true, scale = scale.none)
// scale.none means do not resize the chart to fit this plot
// if the bar being evaluated is the last baron the chart (the most recent bar), then c
cond = barstate.islast
// when cond is true, plot a histogram with a line with height value of 100,000,000,000
// (10 to the power of 20)
// when cond is false, plot no numeric value (nothing is plotted)
// use the style of histogram, a vertical bar
plot(cond ? 10e20 : na, style = plot.style_histogram)
```

## Access the previous value

```
//@version=5
//...
s = 0.0
s:= nz(s[1]) // Accessing previous values
if (condition)
s:=s+ 1
```

## Get a 5-days high

Lookback 5 days from the current bar, find the highest bar, plot a star character at that price level above the current bar

```
//@version=5
indicator("High of last 5 days", overlay = true)
// Milliseconds in 5 days: millisecs * mins * secs * hours * days
MS_IN_5DAYS = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 5

// The range check begins 5 days from the current time.
leftBorder = timenow - time < MS_IN_5DAYS
// The range ends on the last bar of the chart.
rightBorder = barstate.islast

// Keep track of highest `high` during the range.
// Intialize `maxHi` with `var` on bar zero only.
// This way, its value is preserved, bar to bar.
var float maxHi = na
if leftBorder
    if not leftBorder [1]
        // Range's first bar.
        maxHi := high
    else if not rightBorder
        // On other bars in the range, track highest `high`.
        maxHi := math.max(maxHi, high)

// Plot level of the highest `high`on the last bar.
plotchar(rightBorder? maxHi : na, "Level", "-", location.absolute, size = size.normal)
// When in range, color the background.
bgcolor (leftBorder and not rightBorder? color.new(color.aqua, 70) : na)
```

## Count bars in a dataset

Get a count of all the bars in the loaded dataset. Might be useful for calculating flexible lookback periods based on number of bars.

```
//@version=5
indicator("Bar Count", overlay = true, scale = scale.none)
plot(bar_index + 1, style = plot.style_histogram)
```

## Enumerate bars in a day

```
//@version=5
indicator("My Script", overlay = true, scale = scale.none)
isNewDay() =>
    d = dayofweek
    na (d[1]) or d != d[1]
plot(ta.barssince(isNewDay()), style = plot.style_cross)
```

## Find the highest and lowest values for the entire dataset

```
//@version=5
indicator("", "", true)

allTimetHi (source) =>
    var atHi = source
    atHi := math.max(atHi, source)

allTimetLo (source) =>
    var atLo = source
    atLo := math.min(atLo, source)

plot(allTimetHi (close), "ATH", color.green)
plot(allTimetLo (close), "ATL", color.red)
```

## Query the last non-na value

You can use the script below to avoid gaps in a series:

```
//@version=5
indicator("")
series = close >= open ? close : na
vw = fixnan (series)
plot(series, style = plot.style_linebr, color = color.red) // series has na values
plot(vw) // all na values are replaced with the last non-empty value
```

# User Manual • Error messages

# Error messages

• The if statement is too long
• Script requesting too many securities
• Script could not be translated from: null
• line 2: no viable alternative at character '$'
• Mismatched input <...> expecting <???>
• Loop is too long (> 500 ms)

# The if statement is too long

This error occurs when the indented code inside an `if statement` is too large for the compiler. Because of how the compiler works, you won't receive a message telling you exactly how many lines of code you are over the limit. The only solution now is to break up your `if statement` into smaller parts (functions or smaller `if statements`). The example below shows a reasonably lengthy `if statement`; theoretically, this would throw

```
//@version=5
indicator("My script")
var e = 0
if barstate.islast
    a = 1
    b = 2
    c = 3
    d = 4
    e := a + b + c + d
plot(e)
```

To fix this code, you could move these lines into their own function:

```
//@version=5
indicator("My script")
var e = 0
doSomeWork() =>
    a := 1
    b := 2
    c := 3
    d := 4
    result = a + b + c + d

if barstate.islast
    e := doSomeWork()
plot(e)
```

## Script requesting too many securities

The maximum number of securities in script is limited to 40. If you declare a variable as a `request.security`
function call and then use that variable as input for other variables and calculations, it will not result in multiple
`request.security` calls. But if you will declare a function that calls `request.security` — every call to this
function will count as a `request.security` call.

It is not easy to say how many securities will be called looking at the source code. Following example have exactly 3
calls to `request.security` after compilation:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Securities count")
a = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, '42', close)  // (1) first unique security call
b = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, '42', close)  // same call as above, will not pr

plot(a)
plot(a + 2)
plot(b)

sym(p) =>  // no security call on this line
    request.security(syminfo.tickerid, p, close)
plot(sym('D'))  // (2) one indirect call to security
plot(sym('W'))  // (3) another indirect call to security
request.security(syminfo.tickerid, timeframe.period, open)  // result of this line is n
```

## Script could not be translated from: null

`study($)`

Usually this error occurs in version 1 pine scripts, and means that code is incorrect. Pine Script ™ of version 2 (and
higher) is better at explaining errors of this kind. So you can try to switch to version 2 by adding a special attribute in
the first line. You'll get `line 2: no viable alternative at character '$'`

```
// @version=2
`study(5)`
```

## line 2: no viable alternative at character '$'

This error message gives a hint on what is wrong. $ stands in place of string with script title. For example:

```
// @version=2
study("title")
```

## Mismatched input <...> expecting <???>

Same as no viable alternative, but it is known what should be at that place. Example:

```
//@version=5
indicator("My Script")
plot(1)
```

line 3: mismatched input 'plot' expecting 'end of line without line continuation'
To fix this you should start line with `plot` on a new line without an indent:

```
//@version=5
indicator("My Script")
plot(1)
```

## Loop is too long (> 500 ms)

We limit the computation time of loop on every historical bar and realtime tick to protect our servers from infinite or very long loops. This limit also fail-fast indicators that will take too long to compute. For example, if you'll have 5000 bars, and indicator takes 500 milliseconds to compute on each of bars, it would have result in more than 16 minutes of loading.

```
//@version=5
indicator("Loop is too long", max_bars_back = 101)
s = 0
for i = 1 to 1e3 // to make it longer
for j = 0 to 100
    if timestamp (2017, 02, 23, 00, 00) <= time [j] and time [j] < timestamp (2017, 02,
        s:= s + 1
plot(s)
```

It might be possible to optimize algorithm to overcome this error. In this case, algorithm may be optimized like this:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Loop is too long", max_bars_back = 101)
bar_back_at (t) =>
    i = 0
    step = 51
    for j = 1 to 100
        if i < 0
            i := 0
            break
        if step == 0
            break
        if time[i] >= t
            i := i + step
        else
            i := i - step
    step := step / 2
    step
    i

a = 0
for i = 1 to 1e3 // to make it longer
    s := s + bar_back_at(timestamp(2017, 02, 23, 23, 59)) +
         bar_back_at(timestamp(2017, 02, 23, 00, 00))
s
plot(s)
```

## Script has too many local variables

This error appears if the script is too large to be compiled. A statement `var=expression` creates a local variable for `var`. Apart from this, it is important to note, that auxiliary variables can be implicitly created during the process of a script compilation. The limit applies to variables created both explicitly and implicitly. The limitation of 1000 variables is applied to each function individually. In fact, the code placed in a global scope of a script also implicitly wrapped up into the main function and the limit of 1000 variables becomes applicable to it. There are few refactorings you can try to avoid this issue:

```
var1 = expr1
var2 = expr2
var3 = var1 + var2
```

can be converted into:

```
var3 = expr1 + expr2
```

## Pine Script ™ cannot determine the referencing length of a series.
## Try using max_bars_back in the indicator or strategy function

The error appears in cases where Pine Script ™ wrongly autodetects the required maximum length of series used in a script. This happens when a script's flow of execution does not allow Pine Script ™ to inspect the use of series in branches of conditional statements (`if`, `iff` or `?`), and Pine Script ™ cannot automatically detect how far back the series is referenced. Here is an example of a script causing this problem:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Requires max bars back")
test = 0.0
if bar_index > 1000
    test := ta.roc(close, 20)
plot(test)
```

In order to help Pine Script™ with detection, you should add the `max_bars_back` parameter to the script's indicator or strategy function:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Requires max_bars_back", max_bars_back = 20)
test = 0.0
if bar_index > 1000
    test := ta.roc(close, 20)
plot(test)
```

You may also resolve the issue by taking the problematic expression out of the conditional branch, in which case the `max_bars_back` parameter is not required:

```
//@version=5
indicator("My Script")
test = 0.0
roc20 = ta.roc(close, 20)
if bar_index > 1000
    test := roc20
plot(test)
```

In cases where the problem is caused by a variable rather than a built-in function (`vwma` in our example), you may use the `max_bars_back` function to explicitly define the referencing length for that variable only. This has the advantage of requiring less runtime resources, but entails that you identify the problematic variable, e.g., variable `s` in the following example:

```
//@version=5
indicator("My Script")
f(off) =>
    t = 0.0
    s = close
    if bar_index > 242
        t
    t := s[off]
plot(f(301))
```

This situation can be resolved using the `max_bars_back` function to define the referencing length of variable `s` only, rather than for all the script's variables:

```
//@version=5
indicator("My Script")
f(off) =>
    t = 0.0
    s = close
    max_bars_back(s, 301)
    if bar_index > 242
        t
    t := s[off]
plot(f(301))
```

When using drawings that refer to previous bars through `bar_index[n]` and `xloc = xloc.bar_index`, the time
series received from this bar will be used to position the drawings on the time axis. Therefore, if it is impossible to
determine the correct size of the buffer, this error may occur. To avoid this, you need to use
`max_bars_back(time, n)`. This behavior is described in more detail in the section about .

This page contains release notes of notable changes in Pine Script ™.

January 2023
New array functions were added:
• `array.first()` - Returns the array's first element.
• `array.last()` - Returns the array's last element.

2022
December 2022
Pine Objects
Pine objects are instantiations of the new user-defined composite types (UDTs) declared using the `type` keyword.
Experienced programmers can think of UDTs as method-less classes. They allow users to create custom types that
organize different values under one logical entity. A detailed rundown of the new functionality can be found in our
User Manual's page on objects.
A new function was added:
• `ticker.standard()` - Creates a ticker to request data from a standard chart that is unaffected by modifiers like
extended session, dividend adjustment, currency conversion, and the calculations of non-standard chart types:
Heikin Ashi, Renko, etc.
New `strategy.*` functions were added:
• `strategy.opentrades.entry_comment()` - The function returns the comment message of the open trade's entry.
• `strategy.closedtrades.entry_comment()` - The function returns the comment message of the closed trade's
entry.
• `strategy.closedtrades.exit_comment()` - The function returns the comment message of the closed trade's exit.

November 2022
Fixed behaviour of `math.round_to_mintick()` function. For 'na' values it returns 'na'.

October 2022
Pine Script ™ now has a new, more powerful and better-integrated editor. Read our blog to find out everything to
know about all the new features and upgrades.
New overload for the `fill()` function was added. Now it can create vertical gradients. More info about it in the blog
post.
A new function was added:
• `str.format_time()` - Converts a timestamp to a formatted string using the specified format and time zone.

September 2022
The `text_font_family` parameter now allows the selection of a monospace font in `label.new()`, `box.new()` and
`table.cell()` function calls, which makes it easier to align text vertically. Its arguments can be:
• `font.family_default` - Specifies the default font.
• `font.family_monospace` - Specifies a monospace font.
The accompanying setter functions are:
• `label.set_text_font_family()` - The function sets the font family of the text inside the label.
• `box.set_text_font_family()` - The function sets the font family of the text inside the box.
• `table.cell_set_text_font_family()` - The function sets the font family of the text inside the cell.

August 2022

A new label style `label.style_text_outline` was added.

A new parameter for the `ta.pivot_point_levels()` function was added:

• `developing` - If `false`, the values are those calculated the last time the anchor condition was true. They remain constant until the anchor condition becomes true again. If `true`, the pivots are developing, i.e., they constantly recalculate on the data developing between the point of the last anchor (or bar zero if the anchor condition was never true) and the current bar. Cannot be `true` when `type` is set to `"Woodie"`.

A new parameter for the `box.new()` function was added:

• `text_wrap` - It defines whether the text is presented in a single line, extending past the width of the box if necessary, or wrapped so every line is no wider than the box itself.

This parameter supports two arguments:

• `text.wrap_none` - Disabled wrapping mode for `box.new` and `box.set_text_wrap` functions.
• `text.wrap_auto` - Automatic wrapping mode for `box.new` and `box.set_text_wrap` functions.

New built-in functions were added:

• `ta.min()` - Returns the all-time low value of `source` from the beginning of the chart up to the current bar.
• `ta.max()` - Returns the all-time high value of `source` from the beginning of the chart up to the current bar.

A new annotation `//@strategy_alert_message` was added. If the annotation is added to the strategy, the text written after it will be automatically set as the default alert message in the Create Alert window.

```
//@version=5
//@strategy_alert_message My Default Alert Message
strategy("My Strategy")
plot(close)
```

July 2022

It is now possible to fine-tune where a script's plot values are displayed through the introduction of new arguments for the `display` parameter of the `plot()`, `plotchar()`, `plotshape()`, `plotarrow()`, `plotcandle()`, and `plotbar()` functions.

Four new arguments were added, complementing the previously available `display.all` and `display.none`:

• `display.data_window` displays the plot values in the Data Window, one of the items available from the chart's right sidebar.
• `display.pane` displays the plot in the pane where the script resides, as defined in with the `overlay` parameter of the script's `indicator()`, `strategy()`, or `library()` declaration statement.
• `display.price_scale` controls the display of the plot's label and price in the price scale, if the chart's settings allow them.
• `display.status_line` displays the plot values in the script's status line, next to the script's name on the chart, if the chart's settings allow them.

The `display` parameter supports the addition and subtraction of its arguments:

• `display.all` - `display.status_line` will display the plot's information everywhere except in the script's status line.
• `display.price_scale + display.status_line` will display the plot in the price scale and status line only.

June 2022
The behavior of the argument used with the `qty_percent` parameter of `strategy.exit()` has changed. Previously, the percentages used on successive exit orders of the same position were calculated from the remaining position at any given time. Instead, the percentages now always apply to the initial position size. When executing the following strategy, for example:

```
//@version=5
strategy("strategy.exit() example", overlay = true)
strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long, qty = 100)
strategy.exit("Exit Long1", "Long", trail_points = 50, trail offset = 0, qty_percent = 20)
strategy.exit("Exit Long2", "Long", trail_points = 100, trail_offset = 0, qty_percent = 20)
```

20% of the initial position will be closed on each `strategy.exit()` call. Before, the first call would exit 20% of the initial position, and the second would exit 20% of the remaining 80% of the position, so only 16% of the initial position.

Two new parameters for the built-in `ta.vwap()` function were added:

*   `anchor` - Specifies the condition that triggers the reset of VWAP calculations. When `true`, calculations reset; when `false`, calculations proceed using the values accumulated since the previous reset.
*   `stdev_mult` - If specified, the `ta.vwap()` calculates the standard deviation bands based on the main VWAP series and returns a `[vwap, upper_band, lower_band]` tuple.

New overloaded versions of the `strategy.close()` and `strategy.close_all()` functions with the `immediately` parameter. When `immediately` is set to `true`, the closing order will be executed on the tick where it has been placed, ignoring the strategy parameters that restrict the order execution to the open of the next bar.

New built-in functions were added:

*   `timeframe.change()` - Returns `true` on the first bar of a new `timeframe`, `false` otherwise.
*   `ta.pivot_point_levels()` - Returns a float array with numerical values representing 11 pivot point levels: `[P, R1, S1, R2, S2, R3, S3, R4, S4, R5, S5]`. Levels absent from the specified `type` return `na` values.

New built-in variables were added:

*   `session.isfirstbar` - returns `true` if the current bar is the first bar of the day's session, `false` otherwise.
*   `session.islastbar` - returns `true` if the current bar is the last bar of the day's session, `false` otherwise.
*   `session.isfirstbar_regular` returns `true` on the first regular session bar of the day, `false` otherwise.
*   `session.islastbar_regular` - returns `true` on the last regular session bar of the day, `false` otherwise.
*   `chart.left_visible_bar_time` - returns the `time` of the leftmost bar currently visible on the chart.
*   `chart.right_visible_bar_time` - returns the `time` of the rightmost bar currently visible on the chart.

May 2022
`Matrix` support has been added to the `request.security()` function.

The historical states of `arrays` and `matrices` can now be referenced with the `[]` operator. In the example below, we reference the historic state of a matrix 10 bars ago:

```markdown
//@version=5
indicator("matrix.new<float> example")
m = matrix.new<float>(1, 1, close)
float x = na
if bar_index > 10
x := matrix.get(m[10], 0, 0)
plot(x)
plot(close)
```

The `ta.change()` function now can take values of `int` and `bool` types as its `source` parameter and return the difference in the respective type.

New built-in variables were added:
* `chart.bg_color` - Returns the color of the chart's background from the `"Chart settings/Appearance/Background"` field.
* `chart.fg_color` - Returns a color providing optimal contrast with `chart.bg_color`.
* `chart.is_standard` - Returns `true` if the chart type is bars, candles, hollow candles, line, area or baseline, `false` otherwise.
* `currency.USDT` - A constant for the Tether currency code.

New functions were added:
* `syminfo.prefix()` - returns the exchange prefix of the `symbol` passed to it, e.g. “NASDAQ” for “NASDAQ:AAPL”.
* `syminfo.ticker()` - returns the ticker of the `symbol` passed to it without the exchange prefix, e.g. “AAPL" for "NASDAQ:AAPL".
* `request.security_lower_tf()` - requests data from a lower timeframe than the chart's.

Added `use_bar_magnifier` parameter for the `strategy()` function. When `true`, the Broker Emulator uses lower timeframe data during history backtesting to achieve more realistic results.

Fixed behaviour of `strategy.exit()` function when stop loss triggered at prices outside the bars price range.

Added new `comment` and `alert` message parameters for the `strategy.exit()` function:
* `comment_profit` - additional notes on the order if the exit was triggered by crossing `profit` or `limit` specifically.
* `comment_loss` - additional notes on the order if the exit was triggered by crossing `stop` or `loss` specifically.
* `comment_trailing` additional notes on the order if the exit was triggered by crossing `trail_offset` specifically.
* `alert_profit` - text that will replace the `'{{strategy.order.alert_message}}'` placeholder if the exit was triggered by crossing `profit` or `limit` specifically.
* `alert_loss` - text that will replace the `'{{strategy.order.alert_message}}'` placeholder if the exit was triggered by crossing `stop` or `loss` specifically.
* `alert_trailing` - text that will replace the `'{{strategy.order.alert_message}}'` placeholder if the exit was triggered by crossing `trail_offset` specifically.

## April 2022

Added the `display` parameter to the following functions: `barcolor`, `bgcolor`, `fill`, `hline`.

A new function was added:

March 2022

New array functions were added:

• `array.sort_indices()` - returns an array of indices which, when used to index the original array, will access its elements in their sorted order.
• `array.percentrank()` - returns the percentile rank of a value in the array.
• `array.percentile_nearest_rank()` - returns the value for which the specified percentage of array values (percentile) are less than or equal to it, using the nearest-rank method.

Added a new optional `nth` parameter for the `array.min()` and `array.max()` functions.

Added `index` in `for..in` operator. It tracks the current iteration's index.

Table merging and cell tooltips

• It is now possible to merge several cells in a table. A merged cell doesn't have to be a header: you can merge cells in any direction, as long as the resulting cell doesn't affect any already merged cells and doesn't go outside of the table's bounds. Cells can be merged with the new `table.merge_cells()` function.
• Tables now support tooltips, floating labels that appear when you hover over a table's cell. To add a tooltip, pass a string to the `tooltip` argument of the `table.cell()` function or use the new `table.cell_set_tooltip()` function.

February 2022
Added templates and the ability to create arrays via templates. Instead of using one of the `array.new_*()`
functions, a template function `array.new<type>` can be used. In the example below, we use this functionality to
create an array filled with `float` values:

```
//@version=5
indicator("array.new<float> example")
length = 5
var a = array.new<float>(length, close)
if array.size(a) == length
    array.remove(a, 0)
array.push(a, close)
plot(array.sum(a) / length, "SMA")
```

New functions were added:
- `timeframe.in_seconds(timeframe)` - converts the timeframe passed to the `timeframe` argument into seconds.
- `input.text_area()` - adds multiline text input area to the Script settings.
- `strategy.closedtrades.entry_id()` - returns the id of the closed trade's entry.
- `strategy.closedtrades.exit_id()` - returns the id of the closed trade's exit.
- `strategy.opentrades.entry_id()` - returns the id of the open trade's entry.

January 2022
Added new functions to clone drawings:
- `line.copy()`
- `label.copy()`
- `box.copy()`

2021

December 2021

Linefills
The space between lines drawn in Pine Script™ can now be filled! We've added a new `linefill` drawing type, along
with a number of functions dedicated to manipulating it. Linefills are created by passing two lines and a color to the
`linefill.new()` function, and their behavior is based on the lines they're tied to: they extend in the same
direction as the lines, move when their lines move, and are deleted when one of the two lines is deleted.

New linefill-related functions:
- `array.new_linefill()`
- `linefill()`
- `linefill.delete()`
- `linefill.get_line1()`
- `linefill.get_line2()`
- `linefill.new()`
- `linefill.set_color()`
- `linefill.all()`

New functions for string manipulation

Added a number of new functions that provide more ways to process strings, and introduce regular expressions to Pine
Script ™:
• `str.contains(source, str)` - Determines if the `source` string contains the `str` substring.
• `str.pos(source, str)` - Returns the position of the `str` string in the `source` string.
• `str.substring(source, begin_pos, end_pos)` - Extracts a substring from the `source` string.
• `str.replace(source, target, replacement, occurrence)` - Contrary to the existing `str.replace_all()` function,
`str.replace()` allows the selective replacement of a matched substring with a replacement string.
• `str.lower(source)` and `str.upper(source)` - Convert all letters of the `source` string to lower or upper case:
• `str.startswith(source, str)` and `str.endswith(source, str)` - Determine if the `source` string starts or ends with
the `str` substring.
• `str.match(source, regex)` - Extracts the substring matching the specified regular expression.

Textboxes
Box drawings now supports text. The `box.new()` function has five new parameters for text manipulation: `text`,
`text_size`, `text_color`, `text_valign`, and `text_halign`. Additionally, five new functions to set the text
properties of existing boxes were added:
• `box.set_text()`
• `box.set_text_color()`
• `box.set_text_size()`
• `box.set_text_valign()`
• `box.set_text_halign()`

New built-in variables
Added new built-in variables that return the `bar_index` and `time` values of the last bar in the dataset. Their
values are known at the beginning of the script's calculation:
• `last_bar_index` - Bar index of the last chart bar.
• `last_bar_time` - UNIX time of the last chart bar.

New built-in `source` variable:
• `hlcc4` - A shortcut for `(high + low + close + close)/4`. It averages the high and low values with the
double-weighted close.

November 2021

for...in
Added a new `for...in` operator to iterate over all elements of an array:

```
//@version=5
indicator("My Script")
int[] a1 = array.from(1, 3, 6, 3, 8, 0, -9, 5)

highest (array) =>
    var int highestNum = na
    for item in array
        if na (highestNum) or item > highestNum
            highestNum := item
    highestNum

plot(highest(a1))
```

# Function overloads

Added function overloads. Several functions in a script can now share the same name, as long one of the following
conditions is true:

*   Each overload has a different number of parameters:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Function overload")

// Two parameters
mult(x1, x2) =>
    x1 * x2

// Three parameters
mult(x1, x2, x3) =>
    x1 * x2 * x3

plot(mult(7, 4))
plot(mult(7, 4, 2))
```

*   When overloads have the same number of parameters, all parameters in each overload must be explicitly
    typified, and their type combinations must be unique:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Function overload")

// Accepts both 'int' and 'float' values - any 'int' can be automatically cast to 'float'
mult(float x1, float x2) =>
    x1 * x2

// Returns a 'bool' value instead of a number
mult(bool x1, bool x2) =>
    x1 and x2 ? true : false

mult(string x1, string x2) =>
    str.tonumber(x1) * str.tonumber(x2)

// Has three parameters, so explicit types are not required
mult(x1, x2, x3) =>
    x1 * x2 * x3

plot(mult(7, 4))
plot(mult(7.5, 4.2))
plot(mult(true, false) ? 1 : 0)
plot(mult("5", "6"))
plot(mult(7, 4, 2))
```

# Currency conversion

Added a new currency argument to most `request.*()` functions. If specified, price values returned by the function
will be converted from the source currency to the target currency. The following functions are affected:

*   `request.dividends()`
*   `request.earnings()`
*   `request.financial()`
*   `request.security()`

October 2021

Pine Script ™ v5 is here! This is a list of the new features added to the language, and a few of the changes made. See the Migration guide to Pine Script™ v5 for a complete list of the changes in v5.

## New features

Libraries are a new type of publication. They allow you to create custom functions for reuse in other scripts. See this manual's page on .

Pine Script ™ now supports switch structures! They provide a more convenient and readable alternative to long ternary operators and if statements.

while loops are here! They allow you to create a loop that will only stop when its controlling condition is false, or a break command is used in the loop.

New built-in array variables are maintained by the Pine Script™ runtime to hold the IDs of all the active objects of the same type drawn by your script. They are `label.all`, `line.all`, `box.all` and `table.all`.

The `runtime.error()` function makes it possible to halt the execution of a script and display a runtime error with a custom message. You can use any condition in your script to trigger the call.

Parameter definitions in user-defined functions can now include a default value: a function defined as `f(x = 1) => x` will return 1 when called as `f()`, i.e., without providing an argument for its x parameter.

New variables and functions provide better script visibility on strategy information:

*   `strategy.closedtrades.entry_price()` and `strategy.opentrades.entry_price()`
*   `strategy.closedtrades.entry_bar_index()` and `strategy.opentrades.entry_bar_index()`
*   `strategy.closedtrades.entry_time()` and `strategy.opentrades.entry_time()`
*   `strategy.closedtrades.size()` and `strategy.opentrades.size()`
*   `strategy.closedtrades.profit()` and `strategy.opentrades.profit()`
*   `strategy.closedtrades.commission()` and `strategy.opentrades.commission()`
*   `strategy.closedtrades.max_runup()` and `strategy.opentrades.max_runup()`
*   `strategy.closedtrades.max_drawdown()`
*   `strategy.closedtrades.exit_price()`
*   `strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index()`
*   `strategy.closedtrades.exit_time()`
*   `strategy.convert_to_account()`
*   `strategy.convert_to_symbol()`
*   `strategy.account_currency`

A new `earnings.standardized` constant for the `request.earnings()` function allows requesting standardized earnings data.

A v4 to v5 converter is now included in the Pine Script™ Editor. See the Migration guide to Pine Script ™ v5 for more information on converting your scripts to v5.

The Reference Manual now includes the systematic mention of the form and type (e.g., "simple int") required for each function parameter.

The User Manual was reorganized and new content was added.

## Changes

Many built-in variables, functions and function arguments were renamed or moved to new namespaces in v5. The venerable `study()`, for example, is now `indicator()`, and `security()` is now `request.security()`. New namespaces now group related functions and variables together. This consolidation implements a more rational nomenclature and provides an orderly space to accommodate the many additions planned for Pine Script ™.

See the Migration guide to Pine Script ™ v5 for a complete list of the changes made in v5.

September 2021

New parameter has been added for the `dividends()`, `earnings()`, `financial()`, `quandl()`, `security()`, and `splits()` functions:

*   `ignore_invalid_symbol` - determines the behavior of the function if the specified symbol is not found: if `false`, the script will halt and return a runtime error; if `true`, the function will return `na` and execution will continue.

## July 2021

`tostring` now accepts “bool" and "string" types.

New argument for `time` and `time_close` functions was added:

*   `timezone` - timezone of the session argument, can only be used when a session is specified. Can be written out in GMT notation (e.g. "GMT-5") or as an ` overload
    - Reserved keywords
    - Removed `iff()` and `offset()`
    - Split of `input()` into several functions
    - Some function parameters now require built-in arguments
    - Deprecated the `transp` parameter
    - Changed the default session days for `time()` and `time_close()`
    - `strategy.exit()` now must do something
    - Common script conversion errors
        - Invalid argument 'style'/'linestyle' in 'plot'/'hline' call
        - Undeclared identifier 'input.%input_name%'
        - Invalid argument ‘when' in ‘strategy.close' call
        - Cannot call 'input.int' with argument ‘minval'='%value%'. An argument of 'literal float' type was used but a 'const int' is expected
    - All variable, function, and parameter name changes
        - Removed functions and variables
        - Renamed functions and parameters
- To Pine Script ™ version 4
    - Converter
    - Renaming of built-in constants, variables, and functions
    - Explicit variable type declaration
- To Pine Script ™ version 3
    - Default behaviour of security function has changed
    - Self-referenced variables are removed
    - Forward-referenced variables are removed
    - Resolving a problem with a mutable variable in a security expression
    - Math operations with booleans are forbidden

# Introduction

This guide documents the changes made to Pine Script ™ from v4 to v5. It will guide you in the adaptation of existing Pine scripts to Pine Script ™ v5. See our  for a list of the new features in Pine Script ™ v5.

The most frequent adaptations required to convert older scripts to v5 are:

*   Changing `study()` for `indicator()` (the function's signature has not changed).
*   Renaming built-in function calls to include their new namespace (e.g., `highest()` in v4 becomes `ta.highest()` in v5).
*   Restructuring inputs to use the more specialized `input.*()` functions.
*   Eliminating uses of the deprecated `transp` parameter by using `color.new()` to simultaneously define color and transparency for use with the `color` parameter.
*   If you used the `resolution` and `resolution_gaps` parameters in v4's `study()`, they will require changing to `timeframe` and `timeframe_gaps` in v5's `indicator()`.

# v4 to v5 converter

The Pine Script™ Editor includes a utility to automatically convert v4 scripts to v5. To access it, open a script with `//@version=4` in it and select the "Convert to v5" option in the "More" menu identified by three dots at the top-right of the Editor's pane:

Not all scripts can be automatically converted from v4 to v5. If you want to convert the script manually or if your
indicator returns a compilation error after conversion, use the following sections to determine how to complete the
conversion. A list of some errors you can encounter during the automatic conversion and how to fix them can be found
in the  section of this guide.

## Renamed functions and variables

For clarity and consistency, many built-in functions and variables were renamed in v5. The inclusion of v4 function
names in a new namespace is the cause of most changes. For example, the `sma()` function in v4 is moved to the `ta.`
namespace in v5: `ta.sma()`. Remembering the new namespaces is not necessary; if you type the older name of a
function without its namespace in the Editor and press the 'Auto-complete' hotkey (`Ctrl` + `Space`, or `Cmd` + `Space`
on MacOS), a popup showing matching suggestions appears:

```
1   //@version=5
2   indicator("My Script")
3   v1 = highe
4   plot(ta.highest builtin function
5   ta.highestbars builtin function
```

Not counting functions moved to new namespaces, only two functions have been renamed:

*   `study()` is now `indicator()`.
*   `tickerid()` is now `ticker.new()`.

The full list of renamed functions and variables can be found in the  section of this guide.

## Renamed function parameters

The parameter names of some built-in functions were changed to improve the nomenclature. This has no bearing on most scripts, but if you used these parameter names when calling functions, they will require adaptation. For example, we have standardized all mentions:

```
// Valid in v4. Not valid in v5.
timev4 = time(resolution = "1D")
// Valid in v5.
timev5 = time(timeframe = "1D")
// Valid in v4 and v5.
timeBoth = time("1D")
```

The full list of renamed function parameters can be found in the  section of this guide.

## Removed an `rsi()` overload

In v4, the `rsi()` function had two different overloads:

*   `rsi(series float, simple int)` for the normal RSI calculation, and
*   `rsi(series float, series float)` for an overload used in the MFI indicator, which did a calculation equivalent to 100.0 - `(100.0 / (1.0 + arg1 / arg2))`.

This caused a single built-in function to behave in two very different ways, and it was difficult to distinguish which one applied because it depended on the type of the second argument. As a result, a number of indicators misused the
function and were displaying incorrect results. To avoid this, the second overload was removed in v5.
The `ta.rsi()` function in v5 only accepts a "simple int" argument for its `length` parameter. If your v4 code used the now deprecated overload of the function with a `float` second argument, you can replace the whole `rsi()` call with the following formula, which is equivalent:

`100.0 - (100.0 / (1.0 + arg1 / arg2))`

Note that when your v4 code used a “series int” value as the second argument to `rsi()`, it was automatically cast to "series float” and the second overload of the function was used. While this was syntactically correct, it most probably did not yield the result you expected. In v5, `ta.rsi()` requires a "simple int" for the argument to `length`, which precludes dynamic (or "series") lengths. The reason for this is that RSI calculations use the `ta.rma()` moving average, which is similar to `ta.ema()` in that it relies on a length-dependent recursive process using the values of previous bars. This makes it impossible to achieve correct results with a "series” length that could vary bar to bar.
If your v4 code used a length that was "const int", "input int” or “simple int", no changes are required.

## Reserved keywords

A number of words are reserved and cannot be used for variable or function names. They are: `catch`, `class`, `do`, `ellipse`, `in`, `is`, `polygon`, `range`, `return`, `struct`, `text`, `throw`, `try`. If your v4 indicator uses any of these, rename your variable or function for the script to work in v5.

## Removed `iff()` and `offset()`

The `iff()` and `offset()` functions have been removed. Code using the `iff()` function can be rewritten using the ternary operator:

```
// iff(<condition>, <return_when_true>, <return_when_false>)
// Valid in v4, not valid in v5
barColorIff = iff(close >= open, color.green, color.red)
// <condition> ? <return_when_true> : <return_when_false>
// Valid in v4 and v5
barColorTernary = close >= open ? color.green : color.red
```

Note that the ternary operator is evaluated "lazily"; only the required value is calculated (depending on the condition's evaluation to `true` or `false`). This is different from `iff()`, which always evaluated both values but returned only the relevant one.

Some functions require evaluation on every bar to correctly calculate, so you will need to make special provisions for these by pre-evaluating them before the ternary:

```
// `iff()`in v4: `highest()` and `lowest()` are calculated on every bar
v1 = iff(close > open, highest(10), lowest(10))
plot(v1)

// In v5: forced evaluation on every bar prior to the ternary statement.
h1 = ta.highest(10)
l1 = ta.lowest(10)
v1 = close > open ? hl : 11
plot(v1)
```

The `offset()` function was deprecated because the more readable `[]` operator is equivalent:

```
// Valid in v4. Not valid in v5.
prevClosev4 = offset (close, 1)
```

```
// Valid in v4 and v5.
prevClosev5 = close [1]
```

## Split of `input()` into several functions

The v4 `input()` function was becoming crowded with a plethora of overloads and parameters. We split its functionality into different functions to clear that space and provide a more robust structure to accommodate the additions planned for inputs. Each new function uses the name of the `input.*` type of the v4 `input()` call it replaces. E.g., there is now a specialized `input.float()` function replacing the v4 `input(1.0, type = input.float)` call. Note that you can still use `input(1.0)` in v5, but because only `input.float()` allows for parameters such as `minval`, `maxval`, etc., it is more powerful. Also note that `input.int()` is the only specialized input function that does not use its equivalent v4 `input.integer` name. The `input.*` constants have been removed because they were used as arguments for the `type` parameter, which was deprecated.

To convert, for example, a v4 script using an input of type `input.symbol`, the `input.symbol()` function must be used in v5:

```
// Valid in v4. Not valid in v5.
aaplTicker = input("AAPL", type = input.symbol)
```

```
// Valid in v5
aaplTicker = input.symbol("AAPL")
```

The `input()` function persists in v5, but in a simpler form, with less parameters. It has the advantage of automatically detecting input types “bool/color/int/float/string/source" from the argument used for `defval`:

```
// Valid in v4 and v5.
// While "AAPL" is a valid symbol, it is only a string here because `input.symbol()` is
tickerString = input("AAPL", title = "Ticker string")
```

## Some function parameters now require built-in arguments

In v4, built-in constants such as `plot.style_area` used as arguments when calling Pine Script™ functions corresponded to pre-defined values of a specific type. For example, the value of `barmerge.lookahead_on` was `true`, so you could use `true` instead of the named constant when supplying an argument to the `lookahead` parameter in a `security()` function call. We found this to be a common source of confusion, which caused unsuspecting programmers to produce code yielding unintended results.

In v5, the use of correct built-in named constants as arguments to function parameters requiring them is mandatory:

```
// Not valid in v5: `true` is used as an argument for `lookahead`.
request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", close, lookahead = true)
```

```
// Valid in v5: uses a named constant instead of `true`.
request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", close, lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on)
```

```
// Would compile in v4 because `plot.style_columns` was equal to 5.
// Won't compile in v5.
a = 2 * plot.style_columns
plot(a)
```

To convert your script from v4 to v5, make sure you use the correct named built-in constants as function arguments.

## Deprecated the `transp` parameter

The `transp=` parameter used in the signature of many v4 plotting functions was deprecated because it interfered
with RGB functionality. Transparency must now be specified along with the color as an argument to parameters such
as `color`, `textcolor`, etc. The `color.new()` or `color.rgb()` functions will be needed in those cases to join a color
and its transparency.

Note that in v4, the `bgcolor()` and `fill()` functions had an optional `transp` parameter that used a default value of 90.
This meant that the code below could display Bollinger Bands with a semi-transparent fill between two bands and a
semi-transparent backround color where bands cross price, even though no argument is used for the `transp`
parameter in its `bgcolor()` and `fill()` calls:

```
//@version=4
study("Bollinger Bands", overlay = true)
[middle, upper, lower] = bb (close, 5, 4)
plot(middle, color=color.blue)
p1PlotID = plot(upper, color=color.green)
p2PlotID = plot(lower, color=color.green)
crossUp = crossover (high, upper)
crossDn = crossunder (low, lower)
// Both `fill()` and `bgcolor()` have a default `transp` of 90
fill (p1PlotID, p2PlotID, color = color.green)
bgcolor(crossUp ? color.green: crossDn? color.red: na)
```

In v5 we need to explictly mention the 90 transparency with the color, yielding:

```
//@version=5
indicator("Bollinger Bands", overlay = true)
[middle, upper, lower] = ta.bb(close, 5, 4)
plot(middle, color=color.blue)
p1PlotID = plot(upper, color=color.green)
p2PlotID = plot(lower, color=color.green)
crossUp = ta.crossover (high, upper)
crossDn = ta.crossunder (low, lower)
var TRANSP = 90
// We use `color.new() to explicitly pass transparency to both functions
fill (p1PlotID, p2PlotID, color = color.new(color.green, TRANSP))
bgcolor(crossUp ? color.new(color.green, TRANSP) : crossDn? color.new(color.red, TRANSP))
```

Changed the default session days for `time()` and `time_close()`
The default set of days for session strings used in the `time()` and `time_close()` functions, and returned by
`input.session()`, has changed from "23456" (Monday to Friday) to "1234567" (Sunday to Saturday):

```
// On symbols that are traded during weekends, this will behave differently in v4 and v
t0 = time("1D", "1000-1200")
// v5 equivalent of the behavior of `t0` in v4.
t1 = time("1D", "1000-1200:23456")
// v5 equivalent of the behavior of `t0` in v5.
t2 = time("1D", "1000-1200:1234567")
```

This change in behavior should not have much impact on scripts running on conventional markets that are closed
during weekends. If it is important for you to ensure your session definitions preserve their v4 behavior in v5 code,
add ":23456" to your session strings. See this manual's page on Sessions for more information.

`strategy.exit()` now must do something

Gone are the days when the `strategy.exit()` function was allowed to loiter. Now it must actually have an effect on the strategy by using at least one of the following parameters: `profit`, `limit`, `loss`, `stop`, or one of the following pairs: `trail_offset` combined with either `trail_price` or `trail_points`. When uses of `strategy.exit()` not meeting these criteria trigger an error while converting a strategy to v5, you can safely eliminate these lines, as they didn't do anything in your code anyway.

Common script conversion errors

Invalid argument 'style'/'linestyle' in 'plot'/'hline' call

To make this work, you need to change the "int" arguments used for the `style` and `linestyle` arguments in `plot()` and `hline()` for built-in constants:

```
// Will cause an error during conversion
plotStyle = input(1)
hlineStyle = input(1)
plot(close, style = plotStyle)
hline(100, linestyle = hlineStyle)

// Will work in v5
//@version=5
indicator("")
plotStyleInput = input.string("Line", options = ["Line", "Stepline", "Histogram", "Cross"])
hlineStyleInput = input.string("Solid", options = ["Solid", "Dashed", "Dotted"])

plotStyle = plotStyleInput == "Line" ? plot.style_line :
  plotStyleInput == "Stepline" ? plot.style_stepline :
  plotStyleInput == "Histogram" ? plot.style_histogram :
  plotStyleInput == "Cross" ? plot.style_cross :
  plotStyleInput == "Area" ? plot.style_area :
  plotStyleInput == "Columns" ? plot.style_columns :
  plot.style_circles

hlineStyle = hlineStyleInput == "Solid" ? hline.style_solid :
  hlineStyleInput == "Dashed" ? hline.style_dashed :
  hline.style_dotted

plot(close, style = plotStyle)
hline(100, linestyle = hlineStyle)
```

See the  section of this guide for more information.

Undeclared identifier ‘input.%input_name%'

To fix this issue, remove the `input.*` constants from your code:

```
// Will cause an error during conversion
`_integer = input.integer`
`_bool = input.bool`
`i1 = input(1, "Integer", _integer)`
`i2 = input(true, "Boolean", bool)`

// Will work in v5
`i1 = input.int(1, "Integer")`
`i2 = input.bool(true, "Boolean")`
```

See the User Manual's page on Inputs, and the Some function parameters now require built-in arguments section of this guide for more information.

## Invalid argument 'when' in 'strategy.close' call

This is caused by a confusion between `strategy.entry()` and `strategy.close()`.

The second parameter of `strategy.close()` is `when`, which expects a “bool" argument. In v4, it was allowed to use `strategy.long` an argument because it was a "bool". With v5, however, named built-in constants must be used as arguments, so `strategy.long` is no longer allowed as an argument to the `when` parameter.

The `strategy.close("Short", strategy.long)` call in this code is equivalent to `strategy.close("Short"),` which is what must be used in v5:

```
// Will cause an error during conversion
if (longCondition)
    strategy.close("Short", strategy.long)
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)

// Will work in v5:
if (longCondition)
    strategy.close("Short")
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)
```

See the Some function parameters now require built-in arguments section of this guide for more information.

## Cannot call 'input.int' with argument ‘minval'='%value%'. An argument of 'literal float' type was used but a 'const int' is expected

In v4, it was possible to pass a "float" argument to `minval` when an "int" value was being input. This is no longer possible in v5; "int" values are required for "int" inputs:

```
// Works in v4, will break on conversion because minval is a 'float' value
int_input = input(1, "Integer", input.integer, minval = 1.0)

// Works in v5
int_input = input.int(1, "Integer", minval = 1)
```

# To Pine Script ™ version 4
This is a guide to converting Pine Script™ code from `@version=3` to `@version=4`.

## Converter
Pine Script ™ Editor comes with an utility to automatically convert v3 indicators and strategies to v4. To access it, open a script with `//@version=3` in it and select the `Convert to v4` option in the `More` dropdown menu:



Not all scripts can be automatically converted from v3 to v4. If you want to convert the script manually or if your indicator returns a compilation error after conversion, consult the guide below for more information.

## Renaming of built-in constants, variables, and functions
In Pine Script ™ v4 the following built-in constants, variables, and functions were renamed:
* Color constants (e.g `red`) are moved to the `color.*` namespace (e.g. `color.red`).
* The `color` function has been renamed to `color.new`.
* Constants for `input()` types (e.g. `integer`) are moved to the `input.*` namespace (e.g. `input.integer`).
* The plot style constants (e.g. `histogram` style) are moved to the `plot.style_*` namespace (e.g. `plot.style_histogram`).
* Style constants for the `hline` function (e.g. the `dotted` style) are moved to the `hline.style_*` namespace (e.g. `hline.style_dotted`).
* Constants of days of the week (e.g. `sunday`) are moved to the `dayofweek.*` namespace (e.g. `dayofweek.sunday`).
* The variables of the current chart timeframe (e.g. `period`, `isintraday`) are moved to the `timeframe.*` namespace (e.g. `timeframe.period`, `timeframe.isintraday`).
* The `interval` variable was renamed to `timeframe.multiplier`.
* The `ticker` and `tickerid` variables are renamed to `syminfo.ticker` and `syminfo.tickerid` respectively.
* The `n` variable that contains the bar index value has been renamed to `bar_index`.

The reason behind renaming all of the above was to structure the standard language tools and make working with
code easier. New names are grouped according to assignments under common prefixes. For example, you will see a
list with all available color constants if you type 'color' in the editor and press Ctrl + Space.

## Explicit variable type declaration

In Pine Script™ v4 it's no longer possible to create variables with an unknown data type at the time of their
declaration. This was done to avoid a number of issues that arise when the variable type changes after its
initialization with the `na` value. From now on, you need to explicitly specify their type using keywords or type
functions (for example, `float`) when declaring variables with the `na` value:

```pinescript
//@version=4
study("Green Candle Close")
// We expect `src`to hold float values, so we declare in with the `float` keyword
float src = na
if close > open
    src:= close
plot(src)
```

# To Pine Script™ version 3

This document helps to migrate Pine Script™ code from `@version=2` to `@version=3`.

## Default behaviour of security function has changed

Let's look at the simple `security` function use case. Add this indicator on an intraday chart:

```
// Add this indicator on an intraday (e.g., 30 minutes) chart
//@version=2
study ("My Script", overlay=true)
s = security(tickerid, 'D', high, false)
plot(s)
```

This indicator is calculated based on historical data and looks somewhat into the future. At the first bar of every session an indicator plots the high price of the entire day. This could be useful in some cases for analysis, but doesn't work for backtesting strategies.

We worked on this and made changes in Pine Script ™ version 3. If this indicator is compiled with `//@version=3` directive, we get a completely different picture:

![chart]

The old behaviour is still available though. We added a parameter to the `security` function (the fifth one) called `lookahead`.

It can take on the form of two different values: `barmerge.lookahead_off` (and this is the default for Pine Script ™ version 3) or `barmerge.lookahead_on` (which is the default for Pine Script ™ version 2).

## Self-referenced variables are removed

Pine Script ™ version 2 pieces of code, containing a self-referencing variable:

```
//@version=2
//...
S = nz (s[1]) + close
```

Compiling this piece of code with Pine Script ™ version 3 will give you an `Undeclared identifier 's'` error. It should be rewritten as:

```
//@version=3
//...
S = 0.0
S := nz(s[1]) + close
```

`s` is now a mutable variable that is initialized at line 3. At line 3 the initial value gives the Pine Script ™ compiler the information about the variable type. It's a float in this example.

In some cases you may initialize that mutable variable (like `s`) with a `na` value. But in complex cases that won't work.

## Forward-referenced variables are removed

```
//@version=2
//...
d = nz (f[1])
e = d +1
f = e + close
```

In this example `f` is a forward-referencing variable, because it's referenced at line 3 before it was declared and initialized. In Pine Script ™ version 3 this will give you an error `Undeclared identifier 'f'`. This example should be rewritten in Pine Script ™ version 3 as follows:

```
//@version=3
//...
f = 0.0
d = nz (f[1])
e = d + 1
f := e + close
```

## Resolving a problem with a mutable variable in a security expression

When you migrate script to version 3 it's possible that after removing self-referencing and forward-referencing variables the Pine Script™ compiler will give you an error:

```
//@version=3
//...
s = 0.0
s:= nz(s[1]) + close
t = security(tickerid, period, s)
```

Cannot use mutable variable as an argument for security function!

This limitation exists since mutable variables were introduced in Pine Script™, i.e., in version 2. It can be resolved as
before: wrap the code with a mutable variable in a function:

```
//@version=3
//...
calcs () =>
s = 0.0
s:= nz(s[1]) + close
t = security(tickerid, period, calcs())
```

## Math operations with booleans are forbidden

In Pine Script ™ v2 there were rules of implicit conversion of booleans into numeric types. In v3 this is forbidden. There
is a conversion of numeric types into booleans instead (0 and na values are false, all the other numbers are
true). Example (In v2 this code compiles fine):

```
//@version=2
study ("My Script")
S = close >= open
s1 = close [1] >= open [1]
s2 = close [2] >= open [2]
sum = s + s1 + s2
col = sum ==1? white: sum == 2? blue : sum == 3? red: na
bgcolor(col)
```

Variables `s`, `s1` and `s2` are of `bool` type. But at line 6 we add three of them and store the result in a variable
`sum`. `sum` is a number, since we cannot add booleans. Booleans were implicitly converted to numbers (`true` values
to 1.0 and `false` to 0.0) and then they were added.

This approach leads to unintentional errors in more complicated scripts. That's why we no longer allow implicit
conversion of booleans to numbers.

If you try to compile this example as a Pine Script ™ v3 code, you'll get an error:
`Cannot call `operator +` with arguments (series bool, series bool); <...> It means that
you cannot use the addition operator with boolean values. To make this example work in Pine Script ™ v3 you can do
the following:`

```
//@version=3
study ("My Script")
bton (b) =>
b? 1:0
S = close >= open
s1 = close [1] >= open [1]
s2 = close [2] >= open [2]
sum = bton(s) + bton(s1) + bton (s2)
col = sum == 1 ? white : sum == 2? blue : sum == 3? red: na
bgcolor(col)
```

Function `bton` (abbreviation of boolean-to-number) explicitly converts any boolean value to a number if you really need this.
